What should you expect?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/12qj9aa/shopify_inc_shop_stock_has_a_big_earnings_release/", "Created (UTC)": "2023-04-18 03:51:15", "body": "**Shopify** ($SHOP) stock has been one of the best-performing on the Toronto Stock Exchange since its initial public offering in 2015. Although the stock performed poorly over the last 12 months, losing 70% of its value at one point, it has, nevertheless, outperformed over its eight years as a public company.\n\nThe question at this point is, \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d In a few short years, $SHOP went from a small startup to a major company doing over $4 billion per year in revenue. It has been a wild ride, and it\u2019s only natural to wonder what\u2019s next for Canada\u2019s most successful new technology company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/irs49j25gmua1.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f4bc3092f862017642fba1d072235112ad8fd4da\n\n \n\n## Earnings coming up next month\n\nThe most obvious upcoming development for Shopify is its next earnings release. On May 4, Shopify will release its earnings for the first quarter of 2023 \u2014 a release that will reveal important information like\n\n* Revenue;\n* Profit;\n* Important operational information (e.g., new vendors); and\n* Guidance for the next quarter from Tobias L\u00fctke and his executive team.\n\nIt will be a closely watched earnings release. Shopify\u2019s previous release was mixed, showing revenue growing 26%, which was an improvement from the quarter before, but it also showed widening losses. Overall, it was not well received, and investors sold off $SHOP stock when it came out.\n\nOn the first day of trading after $SHOP release came out, the stock fell 16%, thanks to the earnings miss and weak guidance. In the weeks and months that followed, the stock gained back what it had lost and then some, thanks mainly do to improving sentiment toward tech stocks as a whole.\n\nIf Shopify\u2019s next earnings release meet or exceeds estimates, then the company will have a chance to keep the momentum going.\n\n## What to expect\n\nIt\u2019s never easy to predict what a company will achieve in a given quarter. However, we know that Shopify itself is expecting\n\n* High-teens percentage revenue growth;\n* A slight improvement in gross margin (that is, gross profit divided by revenue);\n* Low single-digit growth in operating costs;\n* Capital expenditures continuing at last year\u2019s level; and\n* Stock-based compensation continuing at last year\u2019s level.\n\nGiven that $SHOP expects high-teens growth in sales combined with single-digit growth in expenses, we should expect the profit situation to improve. However, there are some factors that could complicate this.\n\nFor example, Shopify owns a portfolio of listed stocks. If they went down last quarter, they could cause $SHOP to swing back into negative earnings. Global-E Online, one stock that Shopify owns, has risen 32% this year, so is there is reason to think that it will help $SHOP earnings rather than harm them. Nevertheless, we can\u2019t be 100% sure how the cookie will crumble.\n\n## Foolish takeaway\n\nHaving looked at the upcoming developments for Shopify, I think there is reason to believe the company will do well. It continues expecting strong growth, while also lowering its expense growth. It should do well as a business. The stock is another matter: it is rather expensive, trading at 10 times sales. That\u2019s too high for a value investor like me, but other investors may have different experiences with $SHOP stock.", "post URL info": ["https://preview.redd.it/irs49j25gmua1.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f4bc3092f862017642fba1d072235112ad8fd4da"], "author": "Financial_Owl_7245", "ups": "3", "downs": "0", "number of comments": "3", "comments": ["Last earnings EPS -0.49.

But over the last three years I've seen a quite serious decline. Indeed, the share price is down a tragic 53% in the last three years. So it's good to see it climbing back up. After all, could be that the fall was overdone.\n\nWhile the last three years has been tough for Fidelity National Information Services shareholders, this past week has shown signs of promise. So let's look at the longer term fundamentals and see if they've been the driver of the negative returns. \n\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share ($EPS) with the share price.\n\nFidelity National Information Services saw its share price decline over the three years in which its EPS also dropped, falling to a loss. Extraordinary items contributed to this situation. Due to the loss, it's not easy to use EPS as a reliable guide to the business. But it's safe to say I'd generally expect the share price to be lower as a result!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u6wf0z6i3lua1.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7cb6f8bdd8308718c3b397a2985f26c736a83ae8\n\n \n\nIt's probably worth noting I've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which I consider a positive. That said, I think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. This interactive report on Fidelity National Information Services' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further. \n\n## What About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between *total shareholder return* (TSR) and *share price return*. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. I note that for Fidelity National Information Services the TSR over the last 3 years was -51%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the *total* shareholder return.\n\n## A Different Perspective\n\nI regret to report that Fidelity National Information Services shareholders are down 43% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 6.7%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 6% per year over five years. I realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should \"buy when there is blood on the streets\", but I caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Fidelity National Information Services better, I need to consider many other factors.\n\n[https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-fis/fidelity-national-information-services/news/strong-week-for-fidelity-national-information-services-nysef](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-fis/fidelity-national-information-services/news/strong-week-for-fidelity-national-information-services-nysef)", "post URL info": ["https://preview.redd.it/u6wf0z6i3lua1.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7cb6f8bdd8308718c3b397a2985f26c736a83ae8", "https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-fis/fidelity-national-information-services/news/strong-week-for-fidelity-national-information-services-nysef](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-fis/fidelity-national-information-services/news/strong-week-for-fidelity-national-information-services-nysef)"], "author": "Oli_01", "ups": "6", "downs": "0", "number of comments": "0", "comments": []}

($GOOGL, $GOOG)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/12pk7r3/google_stock_is_it_time_to_buy_the_dip_googl_goog/", "Created (UTC)": "2023-04-17 08:03:41", "body": "Google stock has been challenged since the launch of OpenAI\u2019s phenomenal chatbot product ChatGPT. Moreover, after Microsoft\u2019s announcement of investment of 10 billion in OpenAI, they are also going to integrate ChatGPT into their New Bing search engine (getting there before Google). Following that, Google also released their ChatGPT alternatives AI demo, which is a disaster showing the product is not ready yet, Google stock price dropped 12% after the event.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sn9thgk8soua1.jpg?width=1198&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a5e400f0a08961a878cd57acba3e6b2bae8bb763\n\n*(Source:*\u00a0[*Chartr*](https://cbinsights.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0c60818e26ecdbe423a10ad2f&id=142c3f011d&e=61342f0cfc)*)*\n\nWhy ChatGPT brings threat to Google?\n\nThe essence of search engine is Information retrieval, crawling the web and pull data from a static data set, and creating an index of it. As there are tons of information nowadays comparing with 25 years ago when Google was just founded, the problem of this information is there are too much search results for end users. Probably a million search result came out from a random search, and the problem nowadays is users don\u2019t have time to read all. As an alternative, Chatbot gives limited answer or answers to users, seems more efficient ways to display information (a specific answer rather than a list). As users become more lazy to search (human nature), Chatbot maybe a new way to acquire information.\n\nAnother advantage of ChatGPT over Google is it has context. Since ChatGPT is a Chatbot which purpose is to continue the conversation as long as possible, through the conversation with the user, the Chatbot will understand better about user\u2019s questions and thus would give more relevant answers.\n\nBullish points of Google Stock:\n\n1. Facing the external threat from ChatGPT, Google still has its business moat. From human-computer interaction perspective, sometimes users are looking for different formats of data rather than a specific answer. For example, if I want to buy a flight ticket from New York to LA, I would like to see a matrix of results display to compare \u2013 flight schedule, length and price, rather than one specific answer. For another user scenario, if I was searching for a products, I would like to know pros and cons of the product, rather than one-side answer.\n2. The second bullish point if Google\u2019s strong business model makes it generate so much cash that it could accomplish any project if they are willing to put resources into it. Google makes $3 per click, about 3% click-through-rate on ads (5 cents per search on average). The cost per search is 2.5 cents on average, so the profit margin of search is around 50%. On the other hand, ChatGPT cost 30 cents per computing result, which is much higher cost than Google\u2019s search engine model. From business cost perspective, For Google they need $8-20 billion a quarter just to run search results and display them, so for ChatGPT, they would need $80 billion to run from a cost perspective. Google\u2019s strong business model and cash generating power of \\~$100 Billion EBITDA per year would definitely has better advantage than OpenAI for now.\n3. Also as one of the best tech companies in the world, Google\u2019s AI technology probably could also enable it catch up in the AI war. Since bought DeepMind in 2014, Google has used AI for internal solution, improved data center efficiency by 40%, improved ad recommendations and YouTube watch hours and revenue, enabled auto-fill in Gmail and doc and many other usage scenarios.\n\nBearish points of Google:\n\n1. Revenue source too concentrated on search (from paid ads), around 90%. If in the future, Chatbot become the mains stream method people retrieve information, Google\u2019s traffic volume would be much less. That means advertisers would pay less for search ads and Google\u2019s profitability would be largely affected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oijyxtqzroua1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=79775873db5cce810b8cb251b979dd3c9cc79d20\n\n*(Source: visualcapitalist.com)*\n\n2.  As Google\u2019s core business is based on the search engine, the disruption of rising Chatbot may affect the traffic of search engine. There are some limitations of search engine, like it could not understand context, if users search a specific query and put too detailed keywords in the search engine, it would not be searchable. In this scenario, Chatbot could be able to understand detailed meaning through the conversation of the user and then able to give better solutions.\n\nAs for valuation, currently Morningstar analyst gives fair value of $154, and the current price $105 shows $GOOGL stock is undervalued at 29% discount. The safer entry point would be below $92.4. Although Google\u2019s search main business is disrupted by the new AI Chatbot, given its wide economic moat and exemplary capital allocation, I think it would be a good timing to buy the dip with appropriate capital allocation based on individual investors\u2019 risk tolerance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3mb3ktvdroua1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c79f30a37db3f4ecd074259ee10c28a9f08fc7d8", "post URL info": ["https://preview.redd.it/sn9thgk8soua1.jpg?width=1198&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a5e400f0a08961a878cd57acba3e6b2bae8bb763", "https://cbinsights.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0c60818e26ecdbe423a10ad2f&id=142c3f011d&e=61342f0cfc)*)*", "https://preview.redd.it/oijyxtqzroua1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=79775873db5cce810b8cb251b979dd3c9cc79d20", "https://preview.redd.it/3mb3ktvdroua1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c79f30a37db3f4ecd074259ee10c28a9f08fc7d8"], "author": "Gofighting777", "ups": "22", "downs": "0", "number of comments": "25", "comments": ["GOOG is up 20% last month, guy is asking to buy the dip LMAO", "Google been trading at the same level for the past year, it is just market volitality driven by morons who trade high and sell low.

According to the report, plans for the new search engine are still in the early stages, and there is no release schedule yet.\n\nGoogle's new products will try to predict users' needs, with features such as helping users write software code and display ads in search results, and Google is also exploring mapping technology that allows users to use Google Earth with the help of AI and search music through conversations with chatbots. \n\nOther products Google is considering launching are in various stages of development. A tool called GIFI will use AI to generate images that can be displayed in Google Image search results. Another tool, called TivoliTutor, will teach users a \"new language\" through open AI text conversations.\n\nGoogle is facing stiff competition from rival Microsoft Bing.

There are cases you really want Google search as you are doing something that is more transactional.\n\nSo for example I need to find a flight from the US to BKK (Bangkok).

Or I need to book a hotel.\n\nBut then there are times I really want to dig into something and a large language model makes a lot more sense.\n\nSo for example I was watching a movie and really wanted to know where I specific scene was filmed.    Doing this with a regular search engine is just not optimal.\n\nI started with just regular Google and then decided to bring up Bard instead.  That worked so much better and I was able to find the location.\n\nI did then use the answer in a Google search to verify it was not made up.   But with the answer it is very easy to do that.\n\nThe ideal search engine is a combination of regular Google search with Bard also available at the same time.\n\nGoogle has over 96% mobile search market share and that is not going to go away quickly.   So Google has plenty of time to integrate the two.\n\nhttps://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/mobile/worldwide\n\nOne huge advantage for Google is the TPUs.

Yellen's comments were in reference to the recent failures of two banks, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which caused deposit outflows and raised concerns about systemic risk. Yellen noted that policy actions taken to address these failures had stabilized deposit outflows and restored calm to the financial system.\n\nYellen's comments suggest that she believes that the banking industry is taking appropriate steps to manage risk and ensure financial stability, and that this could have implications for monetary policy. If banks become more cautious and tighten lending, it could reduce the need for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to address inflationary pressures. It remains to be seen how banks will respond to the recent failures and whether they will indeed become more cautious in their lending practices. The Federal Reserve will continue to monitor the situation and make decisions based on its assessment of the broader economic and financial landscape.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/um1hdawaleua1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1fed1b53c7b53e533fc481e9bad4ac6844116f3c\n\nYellen is not alone in predicting that bank credit may be reduced due to recent financial sector turbulence. Some Fed officials have called for a more cautious approach as they anticipate lending restrictions from banks in the coming months. However, weekly bank balance sheet data from the Fed has not shown any significant deterioration in lending, and deposit outflows have stabilized after a surge of withdrawals around mid-March.\n\nYellen also discussed how U.S.-led sanctions and export controls on Russia have impacted the country's ability to wage war in Ukraine and how the $60-a-barrel price cap on Russian oil imposed by Western countries has turned Moscow's expected budget surpluses into deficits. The sanctions have forced Russia to seek military equipment and supplies from Iran and North Korea, and Yellen stated that Putin's military is lacking the equipment needed to wage war.\n\nWhen asked about the potential risk of sanctions eroding the dollar's role as the world's reserve currency, Yellen acknowledged the risk but noted that financial sanctions are an important tool that must be used judiciously with the support of allies. The sanctions create a desire for China, Russia, and Iran to find an alternative to the dollar, but this is difficult due to the unique properties of the U.S. Treasuries that back it. Yellen stated that the dollar is widely used globally due to deep capital markets and rule of law, and no other country has the institutional infrastructure to serve the world like the U.S. does.", "post URL info": ["https://preview.redd.it/um1hdawaleua1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1fed1b53c7b53e533fc481e9bad4ac6844116f3c"], "author": "Living-Tracy", "ups": "2", "downs": "0", "number of comments": "1", "comments": ["She literally has zero idea what she\u2019s talking about.

Market leaders **Amazon** **($****AMZN****)** and **Alphabet** **($****GOOG****)** **($****GOOGL****)** experienced stock declines of 50% and 39%, respectively, throughout 2022 as a result.\n\nHowever, the market has seen a surge in 2023, with industries like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing gaining favor with investors. Consequently, companies in these sectors have become increasingly compelling investments before a likely bull run.\n\nDominant in their respective markets, Amazon and Alphabet have seen their companies flourish over the years, and their potent businesses are likely to keep expanding.\n\n## 1. Amazon\u00a0\n\nAn economically challenging 2022 caused steep declines in Amazon's e-commerce business, with its North America and international segments reporting a combined $10.6 billion in operating losses in the fiscal year. As a result, the company's stock remains down over 30% year over year, prompting a buying opportunity.\n\nE-commerce remains a steadily growing industry alongside the rise in online retail sales, with temporary headwinds unlikely to affect Amazon's long-term development. In the meantime, Amazon has a thriving cloud business through Amazon Web Services ($AWS), boasting the largest market share at 34%. The COVID-19 pandemic boosted cloud adoption as numerous companies moved online to suit hybrid working styles. In recent months, advances in AI have similarly boosted the industry, with the technology enhancing cloud services and attracting new clients.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2xk99bup9eua1.png?width=872&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9c72be5096168adbab31cbb088dca32c3cbad1bf\n\n \n\nAmazon's dominance in the industry led $AWS to generate 100% of the company's profits in 2022, hitting $22.8 billion in operating income.\u00a0\n\nRecent challenges have brought down Amazon's stock and e-commerce business. However, the company's long-term outlook is positive, and Wall Street seems to agree. Out of 50 analysts, 46 have rated the company's shares a strong buy or buy. Meanwhile, Amazon's average 12-month price target of $137.37 projects a 34% stock rise, making Amazon a no-brainer investment in 2023 and beyond.\n\n## 2. Alphabet\n\nLast year's sell-off was particularly hard on Alphabet as many businesses slashed their budgets for advertising, the company's primary source of income. Then, the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022 sent Alphabet's stock tumbling further, with the AI chatbot posing a threat to Google's majority market share in search engines.\n\nHowever, the company appears to be back on a growth path. In March, inflation eased for the ninth month in a row, hitting its lowest level since May 2021. Inflation rose 5% last month, down from 6% in February and a peak of 9.1% in June 2022. The news is positive for many tech stocks, including Alphabet. As inflation eases, businesses will be keener to utilize the company's digital advertising services, offering steady revenue growth. \n\nMoreover, Alphabet has responded to the release of ChatGPT and its integration into **Microsoft**'s search engine Bing by pivoting its own business toward AI development. The move has given Alphabet something it has needed for years -- a clear and definitive direction. With little effort, the company has held an over 80% market share in search engines for decades. However, increased competition has lit a fire under Alphabet to retain that market share and develop its rival to ChatGPT, which it calls Bard.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ns4g49x9eua1.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7a5208327403200c9156f4f9bb0db2be928931b9\n\nThe launch of Bard in February was discouraging, with the chatbot sharing inaccurate information at its debut and failing to instill confidence in investors. But Alphabet's dominant influence in search grants it some time to improve its own tech and Google remains a formidable opponent -- even for Microsoft's Bing. Over the long term, I wouldn't bet against the Google company taking the lead in generative AI search engines.\n\nLike Amazon, many experts are bullish about Alphabet's stock, with 47 out of 52 analysts rating it a strong buy or buy.\n\nAs the home of potent brands such as Android, YouTube, and the many services under Google, Alphabet is a leading tech company with attractive long-term prospects. With a 12-month price target of $125, which is 14% higher than its current position, Alphabet's stock is a must-buy this year.", "post URL info": ["https://preview.redd.it/2xk99bup9eua1.png?width=872&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9c72be5096168adbab31cbb088dca32c3cbad1bf", "https://preview.redd.it/4ns4g49x9eua1.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7a5208327403200c9156f4f9bb0db2be928931b9"], "author": "Ben_aid", "ups": "0", "downs": "0", "number of comments": "4", "comments": ["I'll just leave this here\n\nhttps://tokenist.com/alphabet-down-3-in-premarket-after-reports-of-samsung-ditching-google-for-bing/\n\nLook how fragile Google is, that even a rumor can drop it 4%.

They are so far out in front.", "The past year has shown that Amazon's stock is no longer able to justify excessive multiples while the company burns through cash on experiments.  Their core businesses are facing slowing growth, despite their claims that the opportunity is still massive.  On the retail side, they cannot easily steal market share from competitors that have improved their own delivery speeds.  On the AWS side, Microsoft seems to have earned credibility as a viable alternative.  None of Amazon's recent ideas like Alexa, groceries, or healthcare have become profitable.  And the TV/movies division is so desperate to obtain viewers that they are considering buying AMC to have a place to show their mediocre films.  Amazon won't go up significantly until they can show their core businesses are profitable."]}

($SHOP) boasts of strong institutional backing", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/12p5lp4/with_59_ownership_shopify_inc_shop_boasts_of/", "Created (UTC)": "2023-04-16 23:47:48", "body": " \n\n### Key Insights\n\n* Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Shopify's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\n* A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 44% ownership\n* Insiders have been buying lately\n\nEvery investor in Shopify Inc. ($SHOP) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With a 59% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutions have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny from retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence in its future.\n\n## What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Shopify?\n\nShopify already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Shopify's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/5u8c87ra4eua1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9c3a885ccd4267a1412678014c9ac0ca2006a36f)\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. \n\nHedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Shopify. \n\nCapital Research and Management Company is currently the company's largest shareholder with 7.1% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 5.6% and 5.1%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Tobias L\u00fctke, who is the second-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\n\n## Insider Ownership Of Shopify\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership is thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nInsiders do own shares in Shopify Inc. Insiders own US$3.7b worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment.\n\n## General Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, holds a 36% stake in Shopify. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\n##", "post URL info": ["https://preview.redd.it/5u8c87ra4eua1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9c3a885ccd4267a1412678014c9ac0ca2006a36f)"], "author": "No_Cow1", "ups": "2", "downs": "0", "number of comments": "0", "comments": []}

Historically, over the last twenty years, the average retail investor the gets 2.6% annual real returns, compared to 6.8% for professionally managed portfolio. Just holding sp500% gets you above 7%. \n\nSo if you have the self restraint to just buy sp500 and not try to market time or stock pick, do that. If you know you\u2019re someone who will panic when markets go down, or try to stock pick, get a professional money manager to make it harder for you to succumb to your impulses. \n\nLastly, if you\u2019re going to stock pick: 1) maximize your time in market, if you are holding cash for long periods of time trying to time to market, you\u2019re almost certainly going to lose money 2) if you\u2019re picking individual stocks, and just buying what the rest of retail investors are buying, you will almost certainly lose money. 3) playing with options will always lead to losing money, since the expected return of options is the risk free rate, which is below average stock market returns\n\nI have a positive return compared to sp500, the last few years, but that\u2019s because I\u2019ve done nothing Reddit does. I made a lot of alpha going heavy into value stocks in late 2020 during a reopening play, under allocated into tech at the end of 2021, bottom fed some oversold tech stocks, bought Europe and mid caps recently, etc. No meme stocks. No ARKK. No options. No market timing.\n\nLastly, remember, after tax return is all that really matters, and taxes compound over time. So even if you are generating positive returns, if it\u2019s all short term capital gains ( or even long term capital gains but you\u2019re paying it every year, due to the effect of negative compounding), your actual post tax returns are going to be poor. I aggressively tax loss harvest. I\u2019ll take short term gains occasionally, but I make sure at the end of the year I\u2019ve cancelled them out with realized losses.

What works for you may not work for me but typically the trick is to like the stock so much that you don\u2019t care what the price is.

If you buy a boat for $15,000 you look at the boat and you look at the cash and you say to yourself \u201cyeah, I want this boat more than this pile of cash\u201d. With stocks and other liquid assets it\u2019s so easy to buy and sell that people forget that they\u2019re exchanging cash for a digital asset. They wrongly believe they still have the cash and when the stock goes up they believe they have more cash and when the stock goes down they believe they have less cash.

Figure out what makes sense to you so you can control them. I gave you a glimpse of how I control my emotions. \n\n3. Math. When you buy a T-Bill you know exactly what you\u2019re buying. You know the initial price, the coupon, the yield and the total number of dollars you will have received at maturity. There is nothing unknown.

{"id": "12mvw3p", "title": "Is Shopify ($SHOP) stock a buy now?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/12mvw3p/is_shopify_shop_stock_a_buy_now/", "Created (UTC)": "2023-04-15 01:58:12", "body": " \n\n* **Shopify is focusing on getting customers to add additional products.**\n* **Shopify is still growing its revenue at a market-beating pace.**\n* **The stock is quite expensive for the growth it puts up.**\n\n Shopify's business is succeeding, but the stock may not be worth the premium you have to pay.\n\nThe investment thesis for **Shopify** **($SHOP** **1.44%)** has changed significantly over the past few years. It is no longer a customer acquisition story -- it's a customer expansion story. This introduces some new challenges but can also be a valid way to grow the business.\n\nShopify announced a new offering earlier this year\n\nShopify provides e-commerce infrastructure to clients of all sizes and also has some products for in-store capabilities. In 2020, almost every business that didn't have an online presence rushed to set up its systems thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. That wave provided a massive influx of customers for Shopify, but only so many clients are available.\n\nNow, Shopify is focused on getting those customers to adopt more products. Its solutions include Shop Pay (Shopify's proprietary payment-processing system), global expansion, and shipping logistics. Essentially, Shopify is trying to become a one-stop shop for all things commerce, but it's also working on integrating with other products.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h1ae7oqwi0ua1.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a9b022d81fa53b76773a5f9a619f4e487cab0f78\n\n In January, Shopify introduced Commerce Components, which allows clients to pick parts of Shopify's ecosystem and integrate them with other providers. For example, a business might use Shopify's payment system or adopt its global-marketing technology. This expansion has already captured a big customer: Toy maker Mattel has become one of the first clients to adopt this solution. However, Shopify didn't provide any insight into what individual products Mattel adopted.\n\nShopify's operating expenses are growing faster than revenue\n\nShopify divides its revenue into two streams: merchant solutions and subscription solutions. Subscription solutions are the essential products businesses purchase and continuously pay for when getting set up on their platform, while merchant solutions are add-ons that their clients choose, like Shop Pay. Clearly, Shopify's plan is working according to its growth.\n\nTotal revenue increased 26% in the fourth quarter, and Wall Street analysts also expect this success to continue into 2023 and 2024, projecting 19% and 21% growth, respectively.\n\nWhile Shopify continues to deliver on the top line, it's still working toward profitability. In Q4, Shopify's operating expenses increased by 46% year over year, although its Deliverr acquisition attributed a decent amount to this growth. Still, when a company's expenses grow at nearly double the pace of its revenue, it's not a recipe for success.\n\nTo improve its profitability, Shopify enacted some layoffs last July and was one of the first tech companies to do so. However, management believes it has reduced its staff to adequate levels, so investors shouldn't expect any more.\n\nWith Shopify growing its revenue quickly, investors must continue to watch its operating expenses. If these expenses continue to rise at a quicker-than-revenue pace, it's a huge red flag that Shopify may be unable to turn the profitability corner. But that's in the future; what about the stock now?\n\nBecause Shopify isn't profitable, I'll have to value Shopify using a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. At 10 times sales, Shopify isn't cheap, but it's not as expensive as it used to be.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8nrvqh0j0ua1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e3519b68d29aea56423a7e876087d7395d118bef\n\n \n\nAt current prices, Shopify isn't a back-the-truck-up buying opportunity. Instead, I think investors can take a small position and watch the company. Still, I'd avoid getting too large of a position unless Shopify's operating margins move in the right direction or its growth explodes higher.

The IWM did move up to join the QQQ closer to resistance, while SPY remained floating mid-channel.  As earnings season picks up, we will hopefully see volume return to this market, because the light volume over the past couple weeks could be skewing the charts and make it difficult to discern true probabilities.  As it stands, I have a neutral-to-bearish sentiment because despite what could be bullish consolidation underneath resistance levels, the light volume is enough for me to remain skeptical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SPY**:  Much like QQQ, price may be bullishly consolidating -- but -- the light volume and the fact it is doing so underneath 2x resistance levels is enough to make one doubtful.  Still, the consolidation does make 418.31 double top no longer a major resistance level; instead, the channel's upsloping ceiling TL at 428.25 is major resistance.  Major support remains the channel floor at 385.50 -- which makes trading in this range difficult given the risk:reward ratio there.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/novysk63j3ua1.jpg?width=2390&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=265a72d75eca120eefbdeb19c5371f659fae3fe6\n\n**QQQ**:  Consolidation just under the parallel channel's upsloping TL + potential bull flag formation could mean a breakout; however, the fact it is happening on below average volume makes the action suspect & could skew the probabilities.  A breakout would move to major resistance at the 334.42 the August 2022 double top.  If the bullish chart is a fakeout on light volume, then major resistance remains the channel floor at 292.25 + 200 DMA.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5k5fag5wh3ua1.jpg?width=2394&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cf8a3d9ab2fc9c41b792175707cc409d8ce615da\n\n**IWM**:  Price continues to float between major levels, but the fact it is floating (consolidating?) in the lower 1/3 of the recent down move, as well as drifting slowly higher, does put probabilities in the bear's corner for the next move to be a re-test of the 167.46 pivot low, if not major support.

Looks like you have 200k put away. At the 4% rule, to have 80K annually, you will need to have 2 million saved. (none of this accounts for inflation). So if you take the lifetime average of the S&P500, and continue to max your 401K at 20k/yr, at 60 you should have about $2-3M. So you are pretty close to being on track for your goal. Problem will be inflation. If I were you, I'd probably squirrel away an extra 10K/yr for the next 10 years that will give you about an extra million on the retirement side of things to cover that inflation gap.", "176K fund.

For example, when do you want to retire and how much do you want in your portfolio when you retire?", "100k after tax at 7% is going to be very tough.\n\n80K before tax at 8% is reasonable assuming you double your money every 9 years.", "The Google chrome set up", "I've read most of the comments.  Mostly on point.  A couple of picky details for my take:\n\n Your fixed income portfolio is in the Fidelity US Bond Index Fund.  As far as bond funds go, this Fidelity one is pretty reasonable (fees, quality of management, etc.)  The weighed average maturity for this fund is 8.60 years, so relatively long duration.  If you held this fund in 2021-2022, you saw your account 'trimmed' by 30%.  Ouch.  If you just got in at the beginning of 2023, then you're probably stable to slightly increased in NAV.\n\nBond funds (particularly long-dated ones) will decrease in value with an increase in interest rates.  If you think that interest rates will decrease in the next 8.6 years, then a bond fund is probably OK.  If you think that interest rates may go \\*higher\\* in the next 8.6 years, then you are assuming interest rate risk for your bond fund-the same risk that wiped 30% off of the value over the preceding 2 years.\n\nBecause I don't like guessing what interest rates may or may not be in 8 years, I'd either go with INDIVIDUAL bonds / CDs laddered out to 5-6 years.  Hold them to maturity and you'll avoid the mandated reinvestment / turnover in bond funds and therefore avoid the interest rate risk in the outyears that you assume in a bond fund vs. individual bonds.\n\nI notice that you also have Blackrock Equity Index class R.  Have you compared the costs of that fund with just owning the SPY or other large cap index?  Usually these 'proprietary' large cap funds aren't worth the fees.\n\nYou have a (small) real estate index fund in your portfolio.  Real estate has been, and will continue to be IMO, a 'tricky' place to be for the next few years.  Some CRE (commercial) funds have been beaten about the head and neck, others have done OK-ish, but not great.  Personally, I am wary about real estate index funds.\n\nKnow what you own and why you own it.  While there is some benefit in diversification, diversifying into some riskier funds reduces the benefits therein.  Just because you're 'supposed to' have 30% in bonds / fixed income in a model 70:30 portfolio doesn't mean that 30% should be in a BOND FUND (versus individual bonds).  Similarly, while some pundits call for diversification into real estate / gold / precious metals / artwork / international funds, etc. doesn't mean those fit your investment profile or comfort level.  Example: any 'international' equity index fund that I have cannot have / shall not have any China exposure.  My rule.  I want 0.0% exposure to all things China.  Most international equity index funds have more than 0.0% Chinese exposure, so I would put my international equity funds in something like EMXC which explicitly avoids them.\n\nFinally, I'll echo what many others have said.  You're in a good place for your goal at your age.  Well done!  Continue to contribute as much as you can, as long as you can.  Educating oneself about investments and savings is truly a lifelong endeavor.", "r/Bogleheads is where you want to be.

I'm of the camp that interest rates may be rising, so I've kept my bond allocation fairly low.  Unfortunately my 401k options for both bonds and ETFs are very low, which is why I have the investment in the Blackrock Equity Index Class R. It has the lowest expense ratio and closest I could find to SPY or VOO (which is what I am invested in in my taxable account). \n\nI've had a couple comments on the real estate and international allocations, and I'm considering shifting those to more in the Blackrock Index fund.", "Okay thanks I just joined that subreddit.", "Unfortunately, it's my employer sponsored 401k.

But regardless, OP is on the right track.", "IRA contributions are also increased with inflation but because the limit is so much lower the growth of the limit happens slower and is usually smaller. \n\nBoth IRA\u2019s and 401k\u2019s grow in increments of $500 and only increase when the inflation adjustment pushes it past the next multiple of $500. \n\nSince the limit for 401k\u2019s now is $22,500.. a $500 increase is less than 3% so those increases can happen annually. There are some years where multiple $500 multiples have been jumped in a single year. \n\nWhereas for IRAs, $500 is almost 10% of the $6500 limit it will take a few years to get passed the next threshold.", "You're talking about $80,000 to $100,000, right? Do you mean you want to retire with a stable portfolio that will bring you $80-100k a year in income?", ">Do you mean you want to retire with a stable portfolio that will bring you $80-100k a year in income?\n\nYes, correct.

This growth is expected to continue in the coming years, as more and more businesses move their workloads to the cloud.\n\nAccording to Morningstar analyst, Amazon is estimated to be worth $137 per share. This implies a 2022 enterprise value to sales multiple of 3 times and a 1.7% free cash flow yield. Multiples are less meaningful for Amazon given the company's ongoing heavy investment and rapid scaling. However, Amazon is expected to significantly grow its free cash flow as it matures.\n\nOver the long term, e-commerce is expected to continue to take market share from brick-and-mortar retailers. Amazon is also expected to gain market share online. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend by changing consumer behavior and making it easier for people to shop online. Prime subscriptions and the accompanying benefits, combined with selection, price, and convenience, will continue to drive Amazon's retail business. International is also seen as a longer-term opportunity for Amazon. Total retail-related revenue is modeled to grow at a 7% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years.\n\nAWS and advertising are expected to be the critical growth drivers for Amazon over the medium term. These segments earn materially higher margins than the rest of the business, so they are expected to drive margins higher over time. AWS revenue is projected to grow at a 18% CAGR and advertising revenue is projected to grow at a 17% CAGR over the next five years. In total, Amazon is expected to grow at a 10% CAGR through 2027.

According to its 13F filing with the SEC, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc now owns almost one percent of Toast, which is valued at $82,305,000. \n\nToast, Inc is a leading technology provider for restaurants in the US and Ireland. It offers a cloud-based platform called Toast Point of Sale (POS) that streamlines restaurant operations, reduces operating costs, and enhances customer experience. Toast Order & Pay allows diners to order and pay from their mobile devices, while Toast Flex serves as both a server station and guest kiosk. \n\nMoreover, restaurants can benefit from Toast\u2019s handheld device\u2014a POS called Toast Go\u2014that helps servers eliminate errors in orders by facilitating tableside ordering through mobile devices. Lastly, with Toast Tap\u2014a card reader\u2014clients can safely accept various forms of payment and streamline business finances.\n\nShares of TOST opened at $17.97 on Friday with a 50-day moving average of $18.97 and a 200-day moving average of $19.06. This implied stock price indicates that investors have some degree of confidence in the value proposition presented by the company even though it has faced some setbacks in recent times.\n\nSumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc.'s acquisition of Toast's stock symbolizes an investment strategy based on prospects for growth and the adoption rate of Toast's revolutionary technology offerings, which streamline back-office management and modernize customer service experiences.   \n\n## Toast Inc.

There was no reason for JPM to be down in the last month other than people were scared of all banks.\n\n And keep in mind I am still a really big holder of big banks, I just felt wise to reduce exposure.\n\nThe only other concern I had was the way the Swiss government totally screwed Credit Suisse shareholders by literally changing the laws. It was an extremely dangerous precedent to set. I don't think there is a large risk of that happening here in the US but with all the socialism/ nationalize things talk lately we should account for some small risk no matter how unlikely.", "\"people were scared\" perfectly said . It's hype, the sheep just jump. If JPM was to go to $100 now I wouldn't be worried.

If you haven't already listen to Dimon's letters and presentations to shareholders; he is very very smart and very honest about the challenges they face as a bank and he always talks about the rise of the new fintechs and the potential threat they present to JPMs revenues and how they must be on top of their game. In the medium term I think JPM is fairly priced right now and will gain as the markets recover in the next few years.\n\nIn the long term there are definite systemic changes to how banks will operate in the future (eg. much more online vs physical branches, possible more direct consumer access to federal reserve system via FedNow, etc ) I still feel JPM will navigate those well but its just something to keep an eye on."]}

Nobody here can tell you what might have happened without knowing all of your account's positions, because the call spread may not have been the only factor.\n\nIf your entire account balance was dedicated to this spread, they may have closed it because there was nothing left to cover automatic exercise of the long leg in the case of expiration between the strikes, or you were not approved for enough margin to carry the short position in the case of early assignment. There's also dividend risk on the short leg that you have to be prepared to cover.", "Your choices are: Learn and follow the rules that every broker has or cry on the internet.

{"id": "12lnuca", "title": "Better Buy: Shopify ($SHOP) stock or Kinaxis ($KXS)?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/12lnuca/better_buy_shopify_shop_stock_or_kinaxis_kxs/", "Created (UTC)": "2023-04-14 00:11:24", "body": "**Shopify Inc** ($SHOP) and **Kinaxis** ($KXS) are two of Canada\u2019s biggest tech companies. $SHOP produces software that lets people host their own online stores, while Kinaxis develops supply chain management software. The two companies are quite different, but they have similarities. For one, both companies develop AI software and have been rising with this year\u2019s \u201cAI gold rush.\u201d For another, they both develop software that is sold on a \u201csubscription\u201d model, meaning that there is some similarity in their business structures. In this article, I will explore Shopify and Kinaxis side by side so you can decide which one is the better buy.\n\n## The case for Shopify\n\nThe biggest advantage that Shopify has over Kinaxis is in marketing. Shopify counts among its customers some very large online businesses, such as Jeffree Star Cosmetics and Colour Pop. These are companies that do millions of dollars in sales each year. These big accounts are valuable because the more they grow, the more Shopify\u2019s share value grows. Shopify\u2019s subscription plans give it a monthly fee plus a small cut of all sales. As Shopify\u2019s big corporate users scale their businesses, Shopify grows along with them. This is a path to growth that does not require any spending on marketing or even much spending on anything (server costs may increase a little, but that\u2019s it). So, it\u2019s a very big advantage to have as sales potential grows in the pipeline.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i90dpiwjusta1.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a0b7fb8f205d80e9f82fcf694eb96bc2f7735ccb\n\n \n\n## The case for Kinaxis\n\nThe case for Kinaxis comes down to growth, profitability, and valuation.\n\nA couple years ago, a person would have said you were out of your mind if you said Kinaxis was growing faster than Shopify. In 2020, $SHOP grew its revenue at 86% \u2013 $KXS has never had that kind of growth. However, $KXS actually grew faster in the most recent fiscal year, when its revenue increased by 46%. Shopify, in the same period, only grew 21%. So, Kinaxis took the cake on growth. It was a similar story on profitability. In its most recent quarter, $KXS had positive gross profit, operating income, and net income. The only one of these metrics that was positive in Shopify\u2019s case was gross profit. So, Kinaxis was more profitable than Shopify in 2022.\n\nFinally, Kinaxis has a much cheaper valuation than Shopify, trading at:\n\n* 86 times earnings.\n* 10 times sales.\n* 153 times operating cash flow.\n\nIt\u2019s a pricey stock, without a doubt, but Shopify currently trades at 1,759 times analysts\u2019 estimate of next year\u2019s earnings, while having about the same price/sales ratio as $KXS. So, Kinaxis is overall cheaper \u2013 despite being expensive in absolute terms.\n\n## The verdict\n\nGiven the choice between Shopify and Kinaxis, I would most likely go with Kinaxis. $SHOP has a lot of things going for it, most notably its big celebrity vendors, but its cost discipline hasn\u2019t been very good lately. It was profitable in the past, but it isn\u2019t profitable now, primarily to big increases in spending. Kinaxis is growing its revenue even faster than Shopify is, and still manages to be profitable. So, I prefer $KXS stock over $SHOP.", "post URL info": ["https://preview.redd.it/i90dpiwjusta1.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a0b7fb8f205d80e9f82fcf694eb96bc2f7735ccb"], "author": "Vivid_Impression2508", "ups": "3", "downs": "0", "number of comments": "0", "comments": []}

I bet now I\u2019m not even going to get that pony I was promised.", "It's getting pretty tiresome to hear the same mischaracterizations repeated for the thousandth time at this point, but if you actually engage with MMT, you would know that everyone involved strenuously emphasizes that there are always consequences of spending money - just that forced insolvency or default are not among them. You can look up videos from 20 years ago of Warren Mosler talking about how the government sets the price level, and if it increases spending by buying more or paying more for what it's buying, then you will undoubtedly get inflation.\n\nThat's why MMT fans often talk about the need for \"fiscal balancers\" like taxes and unemployment to make sure the budget naturally regulates itself and doesn't get too out of hand. That said, it also acknowledged that if we want at least low and stable inflation, the government is going to have to increase its deficit over time. As MMT explains well, for any given interest rate target set by the Fed, new deficit spending equals more money in the system. So in the MMT view, deficit spending is the true \"money printing\".\n\nWhat the Fed does is more like an asset swap - trading securities for dollars, NOT directly injecting net financial assets into the system, as the Treasury does when it issues bonds (again, we are talking for any given interest rate). Interestingly, this explains why trillions in \"money printing\" QE did not result in the inflation desired; Mosler himself predicted all this way back in the '90s when Japan started QE, and he has been proven fairly right: despite decades of QE and even huge deficits, Japan could barely get out of deflationary territory. Which makes it totally baffling that QE is painted as MMT, when everyone involved in MMT from the godfather onward has been saying for 30 years that QE will not work to achieve its stated objectives, and that it's a misguided policy. The fact that you are parroting the same tired talking points that don't at all reflect the reality of the theory tells me that you have likely never engaged with the actual work of MMT at all, and are probably just regurgitating BS talking points that you heard on CNBC or whatever. If you even read soft currency economics - it's not a super long paper - you would understand why the things you are saying are total mischaracterizations.\n\nMMT says we can't go broke or run out of money or be forced to default on our debt. All of that is the objectively true; no economist worth his salt who actually understands the monetary system would say at the end of the day that it is possible for the US to be forced to default on its debt, or that it could somehow be unable to issue new debt (within the current framework, that is; obviously if the United States was destroyed in a nuclear holocaust or as the result of a civil war, the treasury wouldn't be issuing bonds anymore, but we're talking about the status quo that exists today and for the foreseeable future). Every economist from Paul Krugman to the guys at the Mises institute will acknowledge this point one way or another. In that sense, MMT is totally mainstream, and it only serves to correct the often parroted and objectively wrong notion that the government will \"run out of money\", or be forced to default on its debt - claims made not infrequently by politicians all over the spectrum, usually when their political opponents are expanding the deficit in ways they don't like.\n\nNone of this is to say that \n\n>we can print money at will with no consequences.\n\nThat is insane to suggest and nobody would ever say that. Obviously spending money always has consequences. If it didn't, why would anyone want to spend money in the first place? It would be like saying that you can tax with no consequences. The very fact that this statement is so ludicrous and nonsensical should be a clue that you are either misunderstanding or mischaracterizing MMT.", "Nope, I think the pony will fall through. I think they may still think they found a magic money tree. They use QE so much it is destroying the worth of our dollar. It's good for them that they have us to suffer for mistakes made by them, as usual. It's too bad we all couldn't just print our way out of everything like them. This is small stuff to our leaders. They won't worry about prices rising because of the wealth they own. Hope you get that pony. Soon a pony will cost $5 million dollars.", "That all may be true, but you might want to explain it to the people that did indeed spend the pandemic arguing for endless amounts of spending while refusing to believe it was going to have negative consequences. Like the inflation we are now fighting. \n\nThat may have been a badterdization of what mmt actually teaches, but it\u2019s how politicians, particularly progressive ones behaved. If it weren\u2019t for Joe Manchin we would have had even more spending, and likely even more inflation than we do now.", "I actually agree with almost everything you said, but that doesn't change the fact that its a fundamentally flawed concept.\n\n\nThe entire premise assumes that you can just raise taxes and cut fiscal when inflation finally rears its head.\nIf only the system were ran by an AI and not humans with short term political interests.\n\nCutting spending is HARD and politically unpopular. Raising taxes is HARD and politically unpopular. \n\nAll it takes is one ass hole to say fuck it and keep fiscal spending high during a period of inflation and the entire MMT concept goes to shit. As long as humans are in change of the decision making MMT will never work.", "Please explain why we would want inflation?\n\nIs it not in fact a hidden tax on the poor (i.e. on those who do not own assets)?", "There's obviously a lot of debate about how much various factors play into inflation, and increased fiscal stimulus is only one. Personally I think it's clear that both energy supply restrictions and supply chain issues more broadly are more to blame for inflation - and that's without mentioning other factors like spiking corporate profits. Nevertheless, there are always progressives advocating for more taxation on the more well-off. Joe Manchin is not among them, and I don't give him a lot of credit for torpedoing a bill that would have directly hurt his financial interests.\n\nBut let's imagine that the inflation we're seeing IS a result of stimulus. For better or for worse, that was a policy choice. We closed down thousands of business and put millions of Americans out of work; what option did we really have besides paying people to stay home, other than not shutting down at all? This was the price we paid for the public health measure we took. I'm not crazy about the way we did it, but Republicans and Democrats voted for it alike. They understand MMT well enough, although they don't admit it. Are we really better off putting our heads in the sand and pretending to believe the lies the \"fiscal conservatives\" are willing to tell us? Manchin ultimately voted for the $700B Inflation Reduction Act, just like he voted for the stimulus bills before that.", "Let's be clear: MMT is a theoretical framework that describes the current monetary and financial system. Although there are some policy prescriptions common to MMT theorists, like the jobs guarantee, at its core it simply describes the system as it exists. We DO create new credit more or less constantly through deficit spending; we ARE technically able to spend as much as we want, and I think our recent spending sprees should have proved that beyond any doubt by now. The question remains, as it always has, how do we tax and spend in such a way that meets our economic or political goals?\n\nAs a progressive, I want to reverse rising inequality and make long-term investments for the future prosperity of our nation. And I believe that in the current practical political moment, inflation is a perfectly acceptable trade-off, depending on how it manifests itself. If we spent trillions in new funding on affordable housing, education, healthcare, basic research and innovation, etc, while reducing taxes on working people and increasing taxes on economic rents (like capital gains), we would probably see price inflation in some areas and maybe deflation in other areas. If regular americans, especially struggling poor and working class Americans, see enough real wage gains to offset that, and we end up with a healthier, more educated, more innovative and productive populace, then it's a win, regardless of what is happening with the debt or inflation.\n\nI know, easier said than done. But it seems to me the only other alternative is to continue to allow the wealth and power to concentrate more and more at the top. Maybe I could support tightening the fiscal stance with extremely Draconian progressive tax reform, but if you do this to run a sustained surplus, then you start heading for deflation long-term, and I just don't think that's sustainable long term. As you say, there is just too much political incentive for people to see the money supply grow; I don't know how you can run a political economy without inflation. I suppose that's the dream of crypto, so I'll continue to follow it to see if this can be a viable reality, but I'm admittedly pretty skeptical.", "In short, because inflation encourages people to spend and invest, which is the purpose of money. If you want to characterize that as a \"hidden tax\", fine, but let's not pretend that it somehow squarely lands on the backs of the poor. Not all inflation is created equal; giving billions to poor and working class people we'll have a different impact than giving billions to rich people and corporations, even if both cause some inflation. That's why you have to look at people's real standard of living and the distribution of real resources; \"inflation\" only matters in so far as it affects that distribution. And it is abundantly clear that you can have both inflation and egalitarian policies that grow the economy for everyone and lead to less extreme inequality."]}

In SVB\u2019s case the bank had bought a significant amount of treasury bonds in 2020 when rates were very low, but once rate rose nearly 1,000% in three years the value of their treasury portfolio dropped as bond values move inversely with interest rates. These are called hold to maturity losses, meaning the firm has losses on their balance sheet at current bond prices but will recoup those losses once the bond matures. The issue is when you're a bank and your customers' deposits are largely in fixed income products with massive losses you can't sell your bond portfolio and meet your depositors requests for their money because the deposits you used to buy those bonds have gone down greatly in value. This generally is referred to as interest rate risk and is the reason most banks seek shorter term returns through the 1 or two year treasury. But what would make a depositor so inclined to demand their money back from a bank? \n\nSome banks that have concerning exposure to hold to maturity losses are Charles Schwab. Union City, USAA, Independence bank. Bank of America. Just so you totally understand what this screen is showing you, SVB which is at number 7 is showing HTM losses which equal 101% of their equity. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/935jc3jbwhta1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b283ea4f85261035494b17173b54474916944114\n\n  \nI go back to my previous question, what makes a depositor so inclined to demand their money back from a bank?\n\nWell, if a depositor isn't insured by the FDIC they are scared of losing their savings. The FDIC which is a government program collects fees from banks to insure deposits up to 250K. Under this program if you have 250K or less in your bank account and your bank goes bankrupt you will be covered by the FDIC. Therefore a deposit base which is largely over this 250K threshold of safety may pull their money if they get a hint of financial insolvency from their bank. In SVB\u2019s case on March 9th the firm announced that it needed to raise additional capital, markets and depositors took this as a sign of weakness and businesses and individuals who banked at SVB started pulling money out of the bank.By Friday the 10th the bank was taken over by the government and declared insolvent. All it took was 24 hours because their deposit base was 93% uninsured, meaning if the bank went under those depositors had a lot to lose, which caused a panic. As you can see even in Signature banks case 89% of their depositors were uninsured, which contributed to those depositors pulling their money as their savings was at risk given they were not covered by the FDIC. \n\nThe third factor which has been garnering some attention over the past couple weeks is residential mortgages exposure. Similar to a treasury bill when rates go up the value of an existing mortgage portfolio goes down. Therefore exposure to residential mortgages as interest rates rise and cause cracks in the economy could prove detrimental to many banks. Some of the notable banks with high exposure to residential mortgages relative to equity are Wells Fargo. First Republic, First bank, Bank Of Hawaii. To give an example for First republic bank their residential mortgage portfolio is 569% of their equity, meaning their exposure to residential mortgages is 5X their equity. In 2008 exposure to residential mortgages was a massive driver of many of the banks failing, obviously this is a different situation and many large banks are very well capitalized. But that doesnt mean this exposure to residential mortgages isnt notable. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2mb72zqswhta1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ca251eb54d94369d2e69d21ec87d712bca8deeb3\n\nWhen we take a step back and look at these banking metrics its best to consider the full picture not just any single metric. For example, SVB made it onto two of these three lists as the failed bank was #7 in HTM losses and #3 in uninsured deposits..   \nNow in terms of existing banks that are seen across these lists some clearly do stick out. The first being Bank of NY mellon, the bank has a deposit base which is 96% uninsured which ranks at #2 highest, and is the #30th bank in terms of exposure to residential mortgages which is over 2X the value of their equity, to complete the trifecta Bank of NY Mellon also has the 13th largest exposure to uninsured depositors. Bank of Hawaii also makes the naughty list as the bank has the 8th largest exposure to residential mortgages and has the 12th largest exposure to uninsured deposits. You see Charles Schwab and its subsidiaries on these lists a lot as well for example Charles schwab has three of its subsidiaries in the top 5 of the HTM losses list, also Charles schwab has the 14th largest exposure to residential mortgages relative to equity. First republic also has the 4th largest exposure to residential mortgages relative to equity and the 13th largest uninsured deposit base as 67% of deposits are uninsured. \n\nLook, I'm not a time traveler. I don't know if these banks go under or not, all I can do is use metrics which have historically led to bank failures to determine risk within the banking sector. Yes the FED has implicitly guaranteed depositors which have cooled down panic, but they have not explicitly said we will cover any amount of losses at any bank which makes risk of future bank runs still possible.   \n\n\nWhat do you think let me know in the comments!", "post URL info": ["https://preview.redd.it/0g16fkegwhta1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bb205d527f5dc3e1463b0ec944a94011babd8451", "https://preview.redd.it/935jc3jbwhta1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b283ea4f85261035494b17173b54474916944114", "https://preview.redd.it/2mb72zqswhta1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ca251eb54d94369d2e69d21ec87d712bca8deeb3"], "author": "ValueInvestingGroup", "ups": "4", "downs": "0", "number of comments": "10", "comments": ["Risk is overblown for the larger banks you listed.

But, assuming HTM to become actual loss in my opinion is not appropriate as 1) the bank can borrow from govt facility thus not necessary to dispose most of HTMs; 2) every bank is operating on a margin based on cost of fund thus new loans will address higher costs issue (that's also why loans underwriting becomes more stringent in order to shrink the loan book with the finest quality and best pricing); 3) not all deposit will leave as ordinary people wouldn't hv more deposit than deposit protection and many companies are granted facility with condition to channel the business transaction to the bank.\n\nThe profitability of $FRC and other regional banks may be jeopardized in such crisis but given $FRC past performance I think the company's shares have been oversold.\n\nWhile I don't see another regional bank getting deposit support from big banks, I am still staying with $FRC and will add once I have dividend from other investments.", "What I will add is I bought my house for 100k I still owe 70k in a area that\u2019s around 110 lol they just told me my house worth 195k lol guess who bout to tap some free money lol so I get what your saying", "I actually added some last night. If you have ever read their latest 8k, their performance wasn't that bad except flight of deposit, i.e. loan asset quality still good and AUM still remained at similar scale which kept up fee income, and interest income increased alongside deposit interest exp which indicates they transferred some cost to the borrowers.\n\nanyway, it is a very risky bet as the management looks like not making the full use of govt's facility and cannot explore a way to absorb more deposit (targetting $250k I mean) from retail by leveraging the deposit guarantee scheme.\n\nIf the all the retail investors here can collectively deposit $250k or below (to be protected) to boost it's deposits and buy $FRC at the same time, it is not difficult to see another short squeeze like other meme stocks like $GME.", "This did not age well"]}

It has only been more than a week since the Silicon Valley Bank exploded.\n\nOn March 19, Credit Suisse, a major international investment bank, was inexplicably acquired by its old rival UBS at a cabbage price of US$3.2 billion. You have to know that Credit Suisse is not like Silicon Valley Bank, which is a regional bank and is involved in the entrepreneurial circle. It is one of the 30 systemically important banks in the world, with assets under management of more than 1.5 trillion US dollars.\n\nWhat is this concept? The GDP of Switzerland as a whole is only 800 billion, which is equivalent to two years of GDP, and the final purchase price is only 3.2 billion US dollars. What is this concept? In February, Silicon Valley Bank had a market capitalization of US$18 billion at that time, which was equivalent to five Credit Suisse banks. For this purchase price, UBS reluctantly agreed after the Swiss government packaged a bunch of equity gifts. Let's talk about this in detail later, and the collapse of this former giant was actually because the old man of the National Bank of Saudi Arabia said 'Absolutely Not'. This can be regarded as the hottest meme in the financial circle. People who pay a little attention to financial news should have heard negative news from Credit Suisse in the past two years. Everyone feels that it is about to die every year, but it is still alive and well, and now it is really dead.\n\nYou seem to be having a hard time explaining why it is about to fail, and why it is failing. Let\u2019s unravel this deep mystery together.\n\nCredit Suisse and its old rival UBS have always been deeply bound to the country of Switzerland. Its glory and collapse are inextricably linked with the entire country. Today we will not only talk about the collapse of Credit Suisse The whole ins and outs, and more importantly, we just follow the historical background. Credit Suisse and the Swiss government are inextricably linked. Let\u2019s dig deeper to find out what is Credit Suisse such a behemoth like, and why did it collapse step by step?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Absolutely Not](https://preview.redd.it/z12nkhk56fta1.png?width=291&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5ed15211ac035dec29f3d860745e2a6b5b42e13c)\n\nCredit Suisse was established in 1856, you heard it right, it was in 1856, it has a history of more than 160 years, let\u2019s fast forward to 1934, Switzerland passed a very important bill called the Federal Banking Act, this The core of the bill is two words, which means confidentiality. It roughly means that Swiss banks cannot disclose customer information to anyone. This \"anyone\" also includes any third-party organization, whether it is the US government, the United Nations, or The Swiss government asks me for customer information. As long as the customer does not agree or has any criminal complaints, I can tell him 'no', no, I have to say 'no' to you. Otherwise I might touch this Federal Banking Act.\n\nHave we often heard that Swiss banks are safer than other places, mainly not because their safes are thicker than other places, but because the confidentiality clause has been included in the federal law, which naturally attracts There are many customers around the world who have very high confidentiality requirements. You probably guessed that there must be a lot of dirty money here, such as tax evasion, money laundering, drug dealing, etc., including the Nazis in Swiss banks during World War II. A large amount of gold bars were deposited. Hitler himself deposited 1.1 billion Reichsmarks in UBS, but the idea of the Swiss is quite reasonable. They think I have to remain neutral. I am a bank and I will protect the information security and security of customers. As long as the property is safe, I don't care whether the money is clean or not. Then you see, it has such a safe confidentiality clause, and at the same time it is a neutral country, and its politics is very stable. In addition, Switzerland itself is relatively developed. Its banking industry soared after World War II and became the largest offshore bank in the world. Financial Center.\n\nAt the beginning of 2000, a quarter of the world\u2019s cross-border private wealth was concentrated in Swiss banks, and among the many banks in Switzerland, two giants emerged, let\u2019s call them Credit Suisse and UBS for short. The name I may often say in a while, it\u2019s a bit convoluted, but everyone remembers now, the last one that didn\u2019t work was Credit Suisse, and then the one that bought Credit Suisse was called UBS, and these two companies have always been the same in the early days. A pattern of falling in love and killing each other.\n\nTheir headquarters are in a square in Zurich. They are next to each other. Their business models and customer groups are very similar, and their employees often jump around.\n\nIf you have to talk about the difference, UBS is bigger than Credit Suisse most of the time. Credit Suisse is more flamboyant and wilder, especially its investment banking department, but overall the two are very similar. Just look at Credit Suisse. At the beginning of 2000, it should be said to be its most glorious period. Although its influence in the world is not as high as it is, it must be famous. Take a look at the League in 2007. Table is a ranking list that compares the business performance of various investment banks. Although Credit Suisse does not rank first, it can rank in the top five in fields such as high-yield bonds, IPOs, and mortgage debt. They're all well-ranked. If you expand a little bit, some people want to find a job in an investment bank. In the United States, those big investment banks are called Bulge Bracket Investment Bank. In people's minds, there is a vague ranking of Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3. The \"Tier 1\" \"Basically, they are Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Jr., Citigroup, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch in the United States; the second tier is basically some big investment banks in Europe, such as Deutsche Bank, Barclays, UBS, and of course Credit Suisse. . This classification is not absolute. It is a bit like the feeling of fame in the world. As we said just now, the glory is actually the investment banking business of Credit Suisse, but what it is most proud of is its private bank and wealth. Manage business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Credit Suisse deposit](https://preview.redd.it/elpib54a6fta1.png?width=817&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=008531413c6d6d627031f8bf1e88b81284c3baf8)\n\nAfter a reorganization in early 2000, coupled with the help of Switzerland's confidentiality mechanisms, Credit Suisse's private banking business maintained a growth rate of nearly 20% even during the financial crisis in 2008, and once surpassed its old rivals UBS, which also made its market value reach 80 billion U.S. dollars at one time. Among the major investment banks, Credit Suisse can be said to be one of the least affected by the financial crisis. It must have lost a lot, but it is a penny I didn't even get government assistance, which is already quite remarkable. You have to know that his old rival UBS was rescued by the government's bailout. Then you say that after the financial crisis, investment banks and banking businesses have begun to recover, and Credit Suisse should have risen logically. It was the beginning of the collapse of Credit Suisse, and this collapse lasted for more than ten years. This can no longer be called a collapse, but a gradual melting.\n\nThis is the stock price of JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, UBS and Credit Suisse after the financial crisis. Can you see that the two Swiss brothers are really brothers and sisters? The first thing that happened to Credit Suisse was the private bank. Business, here must protect a lot of money from black and gray industries, and the governments of other countries are very upset when they see it. Various international organizations have launched investigations into various businesses of Credit Suisse since the beginning of 2000, mainly targeting tax evasion. tax evasion. In May 2014, Credit Suisse was convicted of helping American citizens evade taxes. This charge was established and fined 2.6 billion U.S. dollars. In fact, after the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. Department of Justice asked these big investment banks to fine them everywhere, not only Credit Suisse, such as UBS and Societe Generale, also fined a lot of money, but none of these mentioned convictions, and the fines were not as severe as Credit Suisse, so you can imagine. How rampant Credit Suisse used to help those clients evade taxes, but do you know what is the funniest thing, that is, after Credit Suisse was convicted and fined, its stock not only did not fall, but also grew so much, then why do you think it is? , In fact, it has long been known in the market that Credit Suisse does these things for customers, so it is not very surprised by the conviction and punishment.\n\nThis penalty can be regarded as the highlight moment of the US Department of Justice, and it is also the beginning of the blowing of the horn of Credit Suisse.\n\nIn the same year of being fined, in 2014, Switzerland signed a bill called FATCA in the United States. Simply put, you have to provide the United States with the account information of American taxpayers to prevent tax evasion, so this is actually forcing Switzerland to break the law. The previous Federal Banking Act.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act](https://preview.redd.it/z5e9dsye6fta1.png?width=815&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b403fb73c1a8396530f94eccb70d51a741787f30)\n\nIn March 2015, Credit Suisse had a new CEO named Tidjane Thiam. In fact, Tidjane Thiam was a very good banker from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. On the day it was announced that Tidjane Thiam was going to be the CEO of Credit Suisse, Credit Suisse's stock price rose by 7.5%, which shows how optimistic the market is about this person.\n\nThen are you curious, why do I keep talking about Tidjane Thiam? It is because what happened next made the headlines of the major media, that is, the Credit Suisse spy door incident.\n\nThis Tidjane Thiam has always disliked each other with a senior executive of Credit Suisse, and their villas are still next to each other as neighbors. And at a cocktail party at home in early 2019, he and this executive almost got into a fight because of some trivial matters. UBS also recruited a bunch of former Credit Suisse executives. Later, Credit Suisse recruited a bunch of evidence from employees in order to collect evidence, so they hired private investigators to follow them secretly, but they did not expect to be caught on the street. It was right, and after investigation, it was found that this was not the first time that Credit Suisse had done this kind of thing. He had monitored executives and other third parties five times before. In fact, this matter has little to do with the business of Credit Suisse, but the impact is very bad. It hung on the front page for several days, forcing this Tidjane Thiam to resign.\n\nAfter Tidjane Thiam, the new CEO is also the same, ambitious to reform, such as restructuring, cost reduction and so on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Credit Suisse CEO\uff1aTidjane Thiam](https://preview.redd.it/hca0bm5i6fta1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a079bd427de6a9f99e6a54b6d60febb224a41eef)\n\nWhat is ushering in is an even more miserable 2021. We can see that the stocks of UBS and Credit Suisse just now are still half a catty in 2016 and 17. However, it is this 2021 that really begins to divide. First, there is a cooperation with Credit Suisse at the beginning of the year. The thunder of Greensill, a very tight supply chain financial company, cost Credit Suisse's customers US$2.3 billion, and Credit Suisse was also disgraced. Then in March, a major event that caused a sensation in the global financial circle occurred. The family fund Archegos Capital lost 20 billion U.S. dollars in two days, and its investment manager Bill Huang became the man who lost the fastest money in history. And Credit Suisse somehow became the biggest lying gun. In the past few years, Bill Huang secretly conducted super-large-scale derivatives transactions with six investment banks, and Credit Suisse and UBS were among the six investment banks. In the end, their holdings were overly concentrated in a few stocks. In order to win more business from Huang Bill, Credit Suisse actively provided him with high leverage, which is generally not available to other investment banks. Dare to take that kind of leverage. Before 2021, this Bill Huang was betting right. He made a fortune before, and was worth more than 20 billion U.S. dollars at one point. Credit Suisse can earn tens of millions of dollars in service fees a year from him alone. In 2019, the market had a slight decline, because the six major investment banks had a stampede because they stepped on six boats before. They experienced life and death for 48 hours. Goldman Sachs ran the fastest and did not lose much. Others such as UBS lost more than 800 million, Nomura lost more than 2.9 billion, and Credit Suisse lost 5.5 billion, which became the worst among them. Not only did they lose the whole year's profit in two days, but they also became a big financial headlines.\n\nJust after the big incident of Huang Bill\u2019s misfortune, Credit Suisse had another big change of executives, and a new CEO came up. tighten up.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of last year, as the market\u2019s trust in Credit Suisse accumulated over the past century was exhausted bit by bit, a large number of deposits and high-net-worth customers began to withdraw from Credit Suisse, and Credit Suisse lost more than one-third of its value in a single quarter. One's savings are about 140 billion US dollars, and there are more and more rumors in the market that Credit Suisse is about to die. By the end of 2022, its credit spread once soared to more than 300, and you can understand it as the odds of betting that Credit Suisse will fail soon has soared to a high level. Credit Suisse has raised the three-month interest rate to 6.5% in order to attract customer deposits. You can see that this CEO is quite unlucky, but he did something wrong, and he got taken advantage of.\n\nThe Saudi state fund invested US$1.5 billion in Credit Suisse, taking a 9.9% stake. It's a pity that you think you are buying bottoms, but Credit Suisse has no bottoms at all.\n\nBy March of this year, we all know that the Silicon Valley Bank run incident triggered a high degree of tension in the banking system around the world. On March 9th, when the Silicon Valley Bank incident was on the cusp, the US Securities Regulatory Commission stopped Credit Suisse at this time. Regarding the release of the annual report, if there is a problem with it, please don\u2019t publish it. And on March 15, when the chairman of the National Bank of Saudi Arabia, the largest shareholder of Credit Suisse, was interviewed, someone asked him whether Credit Suisse would consider further bailouts because of its tight liquidity. The chairman replied: \"The The answer is absolutely not.\". It\u2019s a bit too radical for you to say that this will definitely not be. I mean, is it necessary to be so individual, especially when the market is so tense, he must not realize that the current financial circle is like the entertainment circle. You are very careful with what you say, you may not know which sentence is not clear, it may detonate the market in an instant, because of this 'Absolutely Not', the stock of Credit Suisse plummeted by 20% that day, by the way, this is not under control Not surprisingly, the chairman of the Saudi National Bank resigned shortly after this incident.\n\nThe Swiss government saw that Credit Suisse was really going to die, but it was anxious. After all, Credit Suisse is really the kind of bank that is too big to fail for Switzerland. The next day, it immediately said to the public: \"Don't worry everyone , With our Swiss government in Credit Suisse, we will not be able to do it, and we have prepared 54 billion Swiss francs to prevent any liquidity problems at Credit Suisse.\" The market sentiment has really stabilized, and stocks are also sluggish. If it rises back, everyone may be used to Credit Suisse's moths coming out every three days, and it feels like a wolf is coming again, and it will be fine in a few days. But the government actually realized that the market\u2019s confidence in Credit Suisse has disappeared, and even if this wave stabilizes first, it will fall sooner or later. The government also doesn\u2019t want to take advantage of this to rescue Credit Suisse, so the government\u2019s announcement of a rescue is actually to stabilize the market sentiment, but behind the scenes it issued a death order with UBS and Credit Suisse, saying that you must reach an agreement in three days. This agreement, you negotiate the terms yourself, anyway, UBS must acquire Credit Suisse, this is an order, not a negotiation. So UBS, Credit Suisse, and the government went through a long 48-hour negotiation.\n\nLet's take a look at the positions and contests of these three parties in this game. First of all, Credit Suisse\u2019s objective is definitely to say that you don\u2019t sell me, and you have to sell an old rival. It\u2019s so embarrassing, so the government can just save me, but the government has made it very clear that this is a notice, not a discussion. So it doesn't have much room for manoeuvre. I just hope that it can be sold at a high price. It is more reasonable for you to use my current market value of seven or eight billion US dollars, and then discount it a little. And you see that UBS will eat the next competitor, I am definitely happy, but the price must not be high, the lower the better. And there is another very critical issue here, which is time\uff0cYou said that the government is really good, you just give me a few days to let me take over such a big shit pot. Credit Suisse is now heavily in debt, covered in thunder, and it is an extremely complicated large organization. You only need to buy a house by yourself. The sky is not sure if it can be settled, you let me buy such a thing in a few days, I don't know how much it is worth. Otherwise, I would offer 1 billion Swiss francs, which is roughly equivalent to 1 billion US dollars. This 1 billion US dollars is roughly equivalent to one-eighth of the stock price of Credit Suisse after it has plummeted for a month at that time. Isn\u2019t the people of Credit Suisse crazy? Are you insulting people? What price is this? Yin said here, you are almost dying, why are you picking and choosing, originally this matter has nothing to do with me, it is already very face-saving for me to be able to make a price in such a short time. So you see, both sides want to sell seven or eight billion, while they are only willing to sell one billion. How can this be discussed?\n\nAfter some games, the Swiss government came up with a solution, which is actually quite insidious. It said that since we can\u2019t afford to offend the shareholder, we must offend some people, or we should offend the creditor. The government waved its hand and wiped out Credit Suisse\u2019s AT1 bonds with a face value of 17 billion U.S. dollars. That is to say, you don\u2019t have to pay back the 17 billion U.S. dollars in bonds after Credit Suisse. Investors and friends are sorry, you invested before. The bond I bought is gone. After all, only a small number of professional financial institutions bought Credit Suisse bonds. The risk-taking ability is much stronger, and the main reason is that the risk of public opinion will be much smaller, and the government returned it to UBS, which is the purchaser 1000 The liquidity guarantee of 100 million Swiss francs has given a guarantee of 9 billion Swiss francs to those unreliable assets of Credit Suisse.\n\nFinally, on March 19, just five days after this 'Absolutely Not' happened, the two parties finally reached an agreement. UBS announced that it had acquired Credit Suisse, a century-old investment bank, for US$3.2 billion. UBS also put down $14 billion, with some guarantees. Of course, this number cannot be calculated simply. Credit Suisse must be such a shitty pot to sell it at such a low price, and what is the concept of the acquisition price of US$3.2 billion? One-tenth of the previous stock price was one-thirtieth of its stock price ten years ago, but one-hundredth of its peak stock price in 2007.\n\nThis sale is now finally sold, so what is the problem that we said just now that it caused the bond to directly default? The priority of bonds is higher than that of stocks. That is to say, if the company has a problem and is liquidated or loses money, the first thing to protect is the money of the creditor, and the loss should actually be the money of the shareholders. But this time the government\u2019s operation is equivalent to making the priority of bonds lower than that of stocks. Of course, he chose to make the default in the bond layer that is already relatively low priority called AT1. In this way, this operation directly irritated creditors and shareholders.\n\nAs soon as the agreement was reached, Credit Suisse announced that it would lay off 9,000 employees. It is estimated that there may be a lot of layoffs after UBS finds out. In that case, UBS is equivalent to spending a sum of money to buy a group like Credit Suisse. , then it must choose some more valuable parts from the middle, such as wealth management or customers, and those things that do not make money are probably thrown away. After all, it didn\u2019t cost much to buy, and it is certain that this is After the fall, the Swiss government will definitely do everything possible to protect this UBS, because it is really a bank that is too big to fail for Switzerland now.\n\nSo, I concluded that the reason why Credit Suisse collapsed is that it has neglected the management of risks in pursuit of profits for a long time, and then the market lost confidence in it after thunderstorms, which led to more than ten years of melting. Just looking at the reason for the collapse of Credit Suisse, it can be regarded as a relatively special case, but now, because everyone's nerves are very tense, it is easy to explode in unexpected places. You can see that Credit Suisse and Silicon Valley Bank seem to have nothing to do with each other except that they are both banks, but their underlying connection is actually the confidence of the market. As for where the next thunder will explode? Some say it's Deutsche Bank, some say it's American commercial real estate, and some say it's Japanese government bonds.

JMP assigned the company a price target of $65 per share.\n\nShopify is a Canadian multinational e-commerce company that provides a cloud-based, multi-channel commerce platform for small and medium-sized businesses. It offers a suite of services that allow merchants to set up their online stores, manage their inventory, process payments, and ship their products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qw9bc5ji5hta1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=175bfe5b8de11a6b398303aacc4c6510d285e974\n\nShopify went public in 2015 and has since become one of the most popular e-commerce platforms in the world. The company has over 4.5 million merchants using its platform, and it processed over $5.6 billion revenue in 2022.\n\nShopify's stock has been on a tear in recent years, and it is now one of the most valuable companies in Canada. The stock is up over 1,600% since its IPO, and it is currently trading at over $47 per share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/47sfn90k5hta1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4a7d45b076892c1a87d9a0df92baf2549ebe2365\n\nBulls\n\n1.  Shopify is attractive to small and medium-sized businesses because it is easy to use and has a wide variety of built-in features that make it a turnkey solution. The company has many experts to help SMBs with website design, photography, and other elements of the process. Shopify also benefits from a large referral and developer ecosystem.\n\n2. Shopify is also benefiting from the growth of e-commerce. The global e-commerce market is expected to grow to over $5 trillion by 2025, and Shopify is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this growth. Shopify has seen strong growth in the past and is expected to continue growing in the future. This is due to the company's robust new merchant additions, increasing GMV ($197billion GMV), and high attach rates.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z2f9ddsk5hta1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5ec3238dc14d103d410d441ff442ff52a1d51b47\n\nBears\n\n1.  Shopify is exposed to the economic cycle, as its core small and medium-sized business customers are more likely to fail during a recession. This is exacerbated by the fact that retail volumes would likely decline during a recession. Additionally, Shopify's management has a strategy of avoiding direct-to-consumer sales, which could limit its growth potential during a recession.\n\n2. The build-out of Shopify's Fulfillment Network will require a significant investment in both financial and management resources. This could be a distraction for management and could also lead to higher costs, which could weigh on Shopify's profitability.\n\n3.  The company is facing increasing competition from other e-commerce platforms, such as Amazon and Etsy. \n\nAccording to Morningstar analyst, Shopify's fair value is estimated to be $45 per share, which implies an enterprise value/sales multiple of 8 times this year\u2019s revenue and a negative 1% free cash flow yield. The forecast includes a continued shift to merchant solutions from subscriptions. Total revenue is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 22%. \n\nRevenue growth will be driven by new merchants on the platform, uptake of the Shopify Fulfillment Network, Shopify Payments, Shopify Shipping, and Shopify Capital, growing gross merchandise value on the platform, and international expansion. The introduction of unspecified new merchant solutions over time, such as more financial-related services, is also assumed, although this is not thought to be a critical factor over the next several years. The failure rate is expected to remain high on the SMB side, but also that successful merchants will grow to become Shopify Plus enterprise customers. Gross margins are expected to increase over time once the fulfillment network is scaling and contributes to leverage on operating expenses in the long-term after pressure over the next few years. Thus, the non-GAAP operating margin estimate expands from 0% in 2022 (actual) to 11% in 2027. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hnrzz79m5hta1.jpg?width=936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ce88a336ec13ed691f3d4d8965221c7ee6e582eb", "post URL info": ["https://preview.redd.it/qw9bc5ji5hta1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=175bfe5b8de11a6b398303aacc4c6510d285e974", "https://preview.redd.it/47sfn90k5hta1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4a7d45b076892c1a87d9a0df92baf2549ebe2365", "https://preview.redd.it/z2f9ddsk5hta1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5ec3238dc14d103d410d441ff442ff52a1d51b47", "https://preview.redd.it/hnrzz79m5hta1.jpg?width=936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ce88a336ec13ed691f3d4d8965221c7ee6e582eb"], "author": "Gofighting777", "ups": "0", "downs": "0", "number of comments": "1", "comments": ["$65 would give a forward PE of 312. \n\nJust no. \n\nI'm not sure what they're smoking.

While the company is expected to tone down its full-year revenue outlook and give more conservative 2023 capex guidance due to milder semi demand recovery in 2H23, Morgan Stanley believes TSMC is still a buy, with over 90% of analysts covering the stock rating it a \u201cbuy\u201d and average potential upside of 16.9%. \n\nAs an investor, there are several reasons why investing in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) may be attractive:\n\nMarket Leader: TSMC is the world's largest semiconductor foundry, with a dominant market position in the production of advanced semiconductor chips used in smartphones, high-performance computing, and automotive applications. The company has a strong reputation for quality, reliability, and technological leadership, which has helped it to maintain its market position.\n\nStrong Financials: TSMC has a strong balance sheet with a significant cash reserve and consistent profitability. The company's revenue has grown steadily over the years, and it has a high return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA). This financial strength allows TSMC to invest in research and development, expand its production capacity, and make strategic acquisitions.\n\nLong-term Growth Potential: The semiconductor industry is expected to continue growing as the demand for advanced chips increases in various industries. TSMC is well-positioned to benefit from this growth given its technological leadership, production capacity, and customer base. Moreover, TSMC's recent investments in new technology nodes and chip packaging technologies could further enhance its competitive position and growth potential.\n\nStable Dividend: TSMC has a history of paying stable dividends, making it an attractive option for investors seeking consistent income. The company has a policy of distributing a significant portion of its earnings as dividends and has consistently raised its dividend payout over the years.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that investing in TSMC, like any other stock, carries risks, such as fluctuations in the semiconductor industry, changes in global economic conditions, and intense competition. Therefore, investors should do their own research, evaluate their risk tolerance, and consider their investment goals before making any investment decisions.\n\nGet more opportunities on [https://www.ainvest.com/](https://www.ainvest.com/).", "post URL info": ["https://preview.redd.it/h1pqnekfegta1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=62a83a7f180500c2da0cb30d8f21ef2226d4b13c", "https://www.ainvest.com/](https://www.ainvest.com/)."], "author": "Living-Tracy", "ups": "0", "downs": "0", "number of comments": "0", "comments": []}

The company's software platform, Foundry, is used by governments and businesses to collect, store, and analyze large amounts of data. PLTR went public in September 2020 and its stock has been on a volatile ride since then.\n\nPLTR's stock price has been on a downward trend since its peak in January 2021. The stock is currently trading at around $8 per share, which is down from its all-time high of $45 per share. \n\nBulls\n\n1.  The company turned profitable first time in Q4 2022, showing the company is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for big data analytics. Palantir's Foundry platform is one of the most advanced big data analytics platforms on the market, and the company is growing rapidly. \n\n2.  Palantir has strong secular tailwinds behind its back as the AI/ML market is expected to grow rapidly due to the exponential increase in data harvested by organizations.\n\n3.  With products targeting both commercial and governmental clients, Palantir has a distributed top line with the noncyclical governmental revenue insulating the firm\u2019s top line during lean times. Palantir\u2019s focus on modular sales could potentially lead to substantially more commercial clients, which the firm could subsequently upsell\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mtzxfb32kbta1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=969a7857ca87a24e6b44d5b23eaa50b4aa85e70d\n\nBears\n\n1.  Insiders are selling. Executives (including their CEO) are selling millions of value of stock starting this year at 8ish dollar price point. The large amount of insider selling action shows they are bearish about the stock or the overmarket, either way, they expect the stock price will go down further. Put money where your heart is, right?\n\n2.  PLTR's business is highly dependent on government contracts. The company's largest customer is the U.S. government, and any changes in government spending could have a major impact on PLTR's business. \n\n3.  Palantir's executive team has made questionable strategic decisions in the past.

They predict that the company's revenue will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 22.5% over the next five years. They expect the majority of this growth to come from commercial clients, as Palantir expands its customer base. They also expect Palantir to continue to expand sales within its existing client base.\n\nIn my opinion, If the economy does enter a recession, it is possible that Palantir could see a decline in revenue and profits.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures advanced 78 basis points, or 0.2%, while Nasdaq-100 futures were flat.\n*****\n> The March consumer price index is slated for release at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists polled by Dow Jones predict that CPI rose by 0.2% in March, compared to a 0.4% gain in February.\n*****\n> The report could impact the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate decision come May.

(MPW) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that invests in healthcare properties. The company owns a portfolio of over 100 hospitals and clinics in the United States and Europe.\n\nBulls\n\n1. MPW is a well-managed company with a strong portfolio of healthcare properties. The company is likely to continue to grow in the long term, and its stock is likely to remain attractive to investors.\n2. Healthcare sector performance:\u00a0The healthcare sector has been one of the best-performing sectors in the stock market in recent years. This is due to a number of factors, including the aging population, the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, and the rising cost of healthcare.\n3. MPW's acquisition strategy:\u00a0MPW has a history of acquiring healthcare properties. The company has acquired over $10 billion in healthcare properties in the past five years. This acquisition strategy has helped MPW to grow its portfolio and to become one of the largest REITs in the healthcare sector.\n4. MPW's dividend yield:\u00a0MPW has a strong dividend yield of 14%.

The healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to changes in government policies, which could create uncertainty for MPW's business.\n2. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the healthcare industry, which could negatively affect MPW's financial performance.\n3. MPW has a significant amount of debt, which could limit its ability to invest in new properties or pay dividends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uhx2szf4hbta1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b8db8f9c558dd9f983355c6760e0e3a0be3ba3e\n\nMPW is currently undervalued.

MPW specializes in healthcare real estate, which could offer stability and growth potential in the long term given the increasing demand for healthcare services.  \nHowever, it's important to also consider the potential risks associated with this sector, such as changes in government regulations or shifts in healthcare industry trends. Additionally, as with any investment, it's important to do proper research and due diligence to evaluate the company's financial health and growth potential before making an investment decision.  \nOverall, while high dividend yields may be attractive, it's important to consider a range of factors and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.", "Technical side looks good, but sentiment of investors of this company is a big issue", "It seems that MPW is trading at a discount compared to its industry peers."]}

Sabesp (SBS): It's an unassuming Brazilian sewage treatment and water infrastructure company, but it has uncannily fast growth. Brazil is a great place to value invest now, since its central bank has handled inflation much better than the fed has, and all its stocks are still at very good lows. In fact, I'd suggest loading up on EWZ, an index fund for Brazilian companies. It's much further below its high than S&P 500 index funds are below theirs, has a very low P/E ratio, and for now has a very high dividend thanks to petrobras.\n2. Dole PLC (DOLE). This was a hunch- fruit prices were set to be fairly stable this year, and Dole has responsible management and good growth history. Ultimately I was rewarded for my guess.\n3. Iris Energy (IREN): DON'T DO THIS! It's a bitcoin mining company that mines bitcoin with renewable energy in remote parts of Canada and Texas. I had a tiny window to snag several additional calls during the recent bitcoin rally, but you might not get the same opportunity (or maybe you will, and I'm not FOMOing enough.) Either way, if you think crypto is volatile, try options on crypto mining stocks- we're talking chunk swings.\n\nEither way, I didn't let my emotions get the better of me, and every time the price of the above stocks declined, I bought the dip, constantly DCAing in and having faith in my gut feeling. Sabesp especially dumped for a short time because of Lula's dithering in unveiling his fiscal framework, and I was able to load up on shares at the bottom.

This suggests that the US labor market is still strong and that inflation is cooling down. Traders are now predicting an 80% probability of a 25 basis points rate hike in May. Investors are becoming more worried about a potential economic downturn in the US. As a result, they are paying close attention to the release of the March CPI and PPI, as well as the minutes of the FOMC March meeting, in search of hints about the Fed's interest rate policy in May.\n\n**Trending Stocks**\n\n[**Mircon** **Technology(MU)**](https://www.ainvest.com/Mircon%20Technology(MU))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ovapc8cye9ta1.png?width=1162&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0465f68c406bbd9ad7d874904951a9c9ca46ce6a\n\nShares of Micron Technology was up by 8.04%.

Fidelity has a better cash back card at 2% vs 1.5%, but Schwab has a better card overall (imo) with the AMEX Plat Schwab.

While it\u2019s increasingly obvious winter in the Northern Hemisphere is done, it\u2019s not quite so clear for crypto holders. Yet Marathon Digital Holdings ($**MARA**) proved to be crypto\u2019s crocus today, as it recovered in the midst of a Bitcoin **(BTC-USD**) recovery as well. Marathon was up just over 14% in Monday\u2019s trading.\n\nBitcoin itself crept back toward $29,210 in Monday\u2019s trading, and that made Marathon Digital look a whole lot better. Bitcoin hasn\u2019t been this high since last June, and now, technical analysis is starting to pivot on Bitcoin, turning what once was support into resistance. This is great news for Marathon Digital, who just posted a record-breaking quarter for Bitcoin mining, putting up a grand total of 2,195 Bitcoin mined in that three-month period. Better yet, this record-breaking stint means that Marathon\u2019s right on track to meet its first-half target of 23 exahashes.\n\nMarathon Digital put quite a bit behind its Bitcoin mining operations. Back in the first quarter of 2022, Marathon Digital hiked its operational hash rate by nearly 200%, which allowed it to move forward with great rapidity, pulling in Bitcoin like nobody\u2019s business. Yet, even as Marathon Digital celebrated incredible progress, something incongruous happened. Its chief financial officer, Hugh Gallagher, announced plans to depart on May 12. That\u2019s only about a year after he stepped in, and Marathon Digital is already looking for a new CFO.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zgdop34q37ta1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=24c8190ae9c6d972e53a1d0e974639f9059c0c7c\n\n Despite the loss of Gallagher, it\u2019s not really impacting analyst support.

In addition, with an average price target of $12.50, Marathon Digital stock has 37.36% upside potential.", "post URL info": ["https://preview.redd.it/zgdop34q37ta1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=24c8190ae9c6d972e53a1d0e974639f9059c0c7c"], "author": "Smile0069", "ups": "2", "downs": "0", "number of comments": "0", "comments": []}

Through this integration, credit unions using Fiserv Portico will have greater flexibility to deploy Bankjoy\u2019s world-class digital banking tools for their members. \n\nBankjoy\u2019s integration with Fiserv Portico will allow more credit unions to deliver a competitive online and mobile banking experience with a modern, intuitive UX that attracts new members while deepening existing member relationships. Live Life Federal Credit Union, based in Fraser, Michigan with more than $60 million in assets, is Bankjoy\u2019s latest client to leverage the integration with Fiserv Portico. \n\nIn addition to the integration with Fiserv Portico, Bankjoy also supports out-of-the-box integrations with several third-party partners, including Allied Payments, Vertifi, UrbanFT, Savvy Money and more. As a result, credit unions on Fiserv Portico will have more opportunities to proactively address members\u2019 needs with the latest technologies without being burdened by lengthy implementation timelines and costly engineering resources.\n\nEngineered by credit union executives, Bankjoy delivers modern banking technology, including mobile and online banking, e-statements, online account opening, online loan origination, and conversational AI to financial institutions of all sizes. Bankjoy continues to evolve its digital product offerings, rolling out several new features, functionalities and integrations in the last 12 months, such as its new, standalone online account opening solution and its new business banking platform. Bankjoy\u2019s commitment to ongoing innovation and its comprehensive suite of integrations makes it easier and more cost-effective for credit unions to deliver truly feature-rich digital banking technology to members, whether they have a retail or business account.\n\n\u201cOngoing digital transformation over the last decade has accelerated the need for financial institutions of all sizes to deliver a state-of-the-art digital banking experience. Their success as an institution depends on this, as the top performing financial institutions see an average of 24-28 digital banking log-ons per account holder each month, which drives revenue growth by an average of 10-15 percent each year, according to McKinsey & Company,\u201d said Michael Duncan, CEO of Bankjoy. \u201cYet, investing in a truly cutting-edge digital banking solution can seem out-of-reach for institutions without extensive engineering resources and IT budgets. Our integration with Fiserv Portico aims to solve this by giving credit unions more flexibility to roll out the digital banking features that today\u2019s members expect in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible.\u201d\n\nFor more details on Bankjoy\u2019s integration with Fiserv Portico, join our webinar on April 18 at 1 PM ET.

Another fund, the ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil ETF (**UCO**), saw outflows of $158.5 million last week, marking its biggest weekly decline since March 2022.\n\nBloomberg considers this a sign for concern that weak demand will outweigh OPEC+'s sharp production cuts. Is this likely? Probably.\n\nMoreover, the arguments about a lack of available capacity (space capacity) \u2014 an explanation that OPEC representatives are fond of using \u2014 will now sound less convincing.\n\nHowever, it's not necessary to look for a significant fundamental basis in the data on fund outflows.\n\nWith the exception of a couple of anomalous inflows and outflows in 2018-19, **BRNT** didn't have substantial funds before 2023.\n\n**UCO**, on the other hand, is a **leveraged fund**. After the recent price spike, profit-taking is logical. If it doesn\u2019t claim the windfall now, the subsequent volatility will effectively reduce it.\n\nBy the way, WisdomTree also has an oil fund with a 3x leverage \u2013 **3BLR**. It lost $23 million, which represents 80% of assets at the beginning of last week.\n\nAgain, this is not surprising. Leveraged funds should be used precisely in this way.\n\nOPEC's ability or inability to control prices **is irrelevant in this case**.", "post URL info": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-10/oil-fund-outflows-may-point-to-demand-concerns-after-opec-cut?srnd=premium-middle-east&leadSource=uverify%20wall)"], "author": "bitkogan", "ups": "13", "downs": "0", "number of comments": "4", "comments": ["In response to the Bloomberg report on the outflows from WisdomTree's Brent Crude Oil ETP (BRNT) and ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil ETF (UCO), I'd say it's essential to consider the context before jumping to conclusions about the implications for the oil market. While it's true that weak demand might outweigh OPEC+'s production cuts, it's also important to remember that these funds, particularly UCO, are leveraged and subject to profit-taking after recent price spikes.  \nI agree with the point about the lack of a significant fundamental basis in the data on fund outflows. It's worth noting that BRNT didn't have substantial funds prior to 2023, and the behavior of leveraged funds like UCO and 3BLR is not surprising. Investors in these funds should indeed be using them in this manner.  \nIn the end, I think it's crucial to separate the actions of these specific funds from the broader market dynamics and not overstate the relevance of OPEC's control over prices in this particular case.", "I believe the production cuts are writing on the wall.  This industry is going through a lot right now.  Solar, wind, ev\u2019s, recession, more non-opec producers, etc etc etc.\n\nBefore i get slammed for a bunch of stuff just remember the supply demand curve goes both ways.  Demand waning because of recession and then even a reduction in need because of wind/solar can easily collapse the prices.  This whole thing is over just 1 million barrels which is roughly 1% change.  Solar and wind growth is ridiculous now.\n\nI might be getting ahead of myself in regards to timing.  I do understand that.", "In the oil market, no one ever accurately predicts the timing, which makes it difficult to forecast prices.\n\nHowever, this isn't about how solar power, wind, and electric vehicles are transforming the market in the long run.\n\nIt's also not about whether prices will jump to $100 per barrel if the recession turns out to be less severe and China's demand recovers. Keep in mind that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is half sold out.\n\nConversely, it's not about whether OPEC will have to repeatedly cut production in an attempt to halt a decline, as it did from 2017 to 2019.\n\nThe future is uncertain, which is why proper positioning is more important. If there's a profit in UCO, it's crucial to lock it in and not wait for renewables to replace hydrocarbons.", "I completely agree with you.  And so many more unpredictable things the usa can stop the sale of oil globally so it would have its own pricing.  Just one example of the many possibilities.\n\nBut i do believe wind and solar are pressuring prices already.  That doesn\u2019t mean its only 1%, still it\u2019s becoming a factor.\n\nChina in a nutshell is a dependent country, if it continues on its path it will have very few who want to trade with it.  Cheap goods in the end leave little money in China considering they have little resources, most come from Australia.  China likes to think it can manipulate its currency but its due for its own serious correction.  Again i think its timing, if it all happens near the same time china gets it the worse.  I just don\u2019t see china having a recovery before it has an actual downturn."]}

The EV maker also cut prices on both versions of its more expensive Model S and Model X by $5,000.\n\n\u201cWe continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds, including Model S/X vehicles in transit to EMEA and APAC,\u201d the company said in a press release.\n\nThe cuts come after Tesla said it delivered nearly 423,000 EV units in the first quarter. Several media outlets have reported that the company\u2019s internal guidance is to deliver 2M cars in 2023 while analysts expect this number to be lower by around 10%.\n\nTesla is due to report its Q1 results on April 19.\n\n**What analysts are saying about price cuts**\n\nWhile Tesla is attempting to reaccelerate growth by offering cars at lower prices, analysts warn that the company\u2019s margins could be at risk. The Street sees Tesla reporting a 21.1% auto gross margin for Q1.\n\nWells Fargo analysts believe Tesla will miss the >20% target for auto gross margins.

We prefer staying opportunistic.\u201d\n\nFinally, Bernstein analysts expect Tesla to continue cutting prices to stimulate demand.\n\n\u201cWe note that lead times were relatively weak (<4 weeks) for nearly all Tesla models in all geographies, \\*except\\* for the Model Y in the US. The fact that Tesla is cutting price on its longest lead time model suggests other price cuts are likely to follow, particularly since Model 3 SR rebates will fall $3750 on 4/18, and competition continues to intensify.\"\n\nGiven that they expect more price cuts, the analysts also don\u2019t believe that Q1 margins may be the bottom. They expect Q1 auto gross margin of 20.5%, missing the 21.1% consensus.\n\n\u201cWe maintain that price cuts have and will undermine industry profitability (including Tesla's), but that incumbents are deep pocketed and not likely to back down. Some investors maintain that Tesla's recent price cuts reflect a structural cost advantage that will enable it to pressure rivals and capture outsize volume and dominate the EV market. Ultimately, we believe that the automotive market is hyper-competitive, and very difficult for any OEM to sustain an ongoing competitive cost advantage,\u201d they finally concluded.\n\n [https://in.investing.com/news/tesla-stock-dips-as-analysts-warn-price-cuts-will-weigh-on-margins-432SI-3592187?dicbo=v2-TqFwGoT](https://in.investing.com/news/tesla-stock-dips-as-analysts-warn-price-cuts-will-weigh-on-margins-432SI-3592187?dicbo=v2-TqFwGoT)", "post URL info": ["https://in.investing.com/news/tesla-stock-dips-as-analysts-warn-price-cuts-will-weigh-on-margins-432SI-3592187?dicbo=v2-TqFwGoT](https://in.investing.com/news/tesla-stock-dips-as-analysts-warn-price-cuts-will-weigh-on-margins-432SI-3592187?dicbo=v2-TqFwGoT)"], "author": "Otherwise_Plum9333", "ups": "0", "downs": "0", "number of comments": "2", "comments": ["tuesday am up 2.69 lfg!", "Calls it is"]}

This figure brought the quarter\u2019s production figure to 475 \u2013 the firm said in its first update for 2023 that it mined 188 BTC in January. Hut 8, which also operates headquarters in Canada, reported in the Apr 5 report that it sold 240 Bitcoin, coming from its February batch and partly from March. Still, the miner is one of the biggest holders of the asset among peers in its niche. Its self-mined reserve of 9,133 BTC claims the top spot among publicly traded companies with Bitcoin in the treasuries.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/3fw6o05p68ta1.png?width=754&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=91288653b8e96247256e4e3bff5902c80b0e34e7)\n\nEarlier in February, Hut 8 and US Bitcoin announced a \u2018merger of equals\u2019 arrangement to realize a \u2018preeminent digital asset mining, hosting, managed infrastructure operations, and high performance computing organization,\u2019 according to a joint statement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/6h23tjas68ta1.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=70546775f1eee0ea5edeca4fc260e26b6e917e6b)\n\nIn the latest operational update, the mining company said it had commenced remediation plans on its site in Alberta. Hut 8 mining facilities in Medicine Hat also reached an all-time operating high of 1.72 EH/s. The growth was attributable to augmented energization following the transfer of around 1,000 miners from its North Bay site.\n\n### Sphere 3D files lawsuit founded on attack allegations against Gryphon\n\n   \nCanadian Bitcoin miner Sphere 3D is suing its partner Gryphon Digital Mining, alleging failure to act in the best interest after erroneous Bitcoin transactions. The Mississauga-based net carbon-neutral miner outlined in the litigation filed with the Southern District of New York that Gryphon lost $500,000 worth of Bitcoin belonging to it in a spoofing attack. The two companies put in place the current arrangement, which bestows 'fiduciary duties' of Sphere's digital assets mining operation upon Gryphon, in August 2021. Sphere 3D seeks to be reimbursed not less than $75,000 \"exclusive of interest and costs\" as a result of poor services provided. \n\n### TeraWulf reports a 63% monthly increase in BTC production in March\n\nTeraWulf also shared its production and operational update for March this week, reporting a 50% increase in the operating hash rate for the month. The addition increased the company\u2019s hashrate to 3.3 EH/s from $2.8 EH/s. TeraWulf\u2019s entire network consists of 18,000 (13,000 self-miners and 5,000 hosted) operational miners in its New York facility.

Total expenses attributable to power totaled $2.3 million, consistent with a target of $0.035/kWh across its two sites. Its active fleet comprised 27,200 miners, and it boasts a 91% zero-carbon energy claim. Building 2 at Lake Mariner is nearing completion, and TeraWulf plans to secure an additional 50 MW of self-mining capacity in the coming weeks to meet its 160 MW operating capacity target for Q2. \n\n### Marathon Digital\u2019s Q1 2023 growth hit record levels as it mined 2,195 Bitcoin\n\nMarathon Digital separately reported a record production of 2,195 Bitcoin mined in the first quarter of 2023, worth around $62 million as of the announcement on Monday. The quarterly results meant Marathon enjoyed a 74% bump from the same period last year and a 41% increase from Q4 2022.

CEO and Chairman Fred Thiel reported a 64% increase in the operational hash rate, rising from 7 to 11.5, and continuous improvement in hash rate consistency.

As of Mar 31, there were 11,466 Bitcoin in its coffers, equivalent to $326.5 million and just over $321 million at the time of writing. Marathon reduced its debt by $50 million and increased its unrestricted Bitcoin holdings by 3,132 Bitcoin after prepaying its term loan and terminating its credit facilities with the now-defunct Silvergate Bank.

An in-line/softer gross margin outcome could revive concerns over capacity/product aging while placing 2023 consensus estimates at risk since they call for improving gross margins throughout the year,\u201d they wrote in a note.\n\n\u201cAt \\~46x \u201823 consensus EPS, we don\u2019t think the latter outcome is currently priced-in, making for a less than compelling risk/reward into the quarter under the current macro backdrop. We prefer staying opportunistic.\u201d\n\nFinally, Bernstein analysts expect Tesla to continue cutting prices to stimulate demand.\n\n\u201cWe note that lead times were relatively weak (<4 weeks) for nearly all Tesla models in all geographies, \\*except\\* for the Model Y in the US. The fact that Tesla is cutting price on its longest lead time model suggests other price cuts are likely to follow, particularly since Model 3 SR rebates will fall $3750 on 4/18, and competition continues to intensify.\"\n\nGiven that they expect more price cuts, the analysts also don\u2019t believe that Q1 margins may be the bottom. They expect Q1 auto gross margin of 20.5%, missing the 21.1% consensus.\n\n\u201cWe maintain that price cuts have and will undermine industry profitability (including Tesla's), but that incumbents are deep pocketed and not likely to back down. Some investors maintain that Tesla's recent price cuts reflect a structural cost advantage that will enable it to pressure rivals and capture outsize volume and dominate the EV market. Ultimately, we believe that the automotive market is hyper-competitive, and very difficult for any OEM to sustain an ongoing competitive cost advantage,\u201d they finally concluded.\n\n [https://in.investing.com/news/tesla-stock-dips-as-analysts-warn-price-cuts-will-weigh-on-margins-432SI-3592187?dicbo=v2-TqFwGoT](https://in.investing.com/news/tesla-stock-dips-as-analysts-warn-price-cuts-will-weigh-on-margins-432SI-3592187?dicbo=v2-TqFwGoT)", "post URL info": ["https://in.investing.com/news/tesla-stock-dips-as-analysts-warn-price-cuts-will-weigh-on-margins-432SI-3592187?dicbo=v2-TqFwGoT](https://in.investing.com/news/tesla-stock-dips-as-analysts-warn-price-cuts-will-weigh-on-margins-432SI-3592187?dicbo=v2-TqFwGoT)"], "author": "Otherwise_Plum9333", "ups": "0", "downs": "0", "number of comments": "0", "comments": []}

[DD]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/12hew7u/a_deep_dive_on_paypal_is_it_a_good_time_to_buy_dd/", "Created (UTC)": "2023-04-10 03:44:32", "body": "A couple of years ago, PayPal was all the hype. Today, the stock is down 75% from its all-time high. Once a growth stock, PayPal is now moving towards value stock territory. The big question here is this. Is PayPal worth buying right now? Is it a bargain or is it a value trap?\n\n# Operations\n\nFirst of all, let's look at PayPal's operations. PayPal's main source of revenue are the fees that PayPal charges for completing transactions and other payment-related services. Other revenue sources include foreign currency conversion fees and also fees for purchasing or selling cryptocurrencies. As such, PayPal's business model is based on the volume of transactions. The more transactions, the more fees the company gets. In 2022, users, transactions and payment volume on PayPal increased.\n\n* 2% increase in users to 435 million with 8.6 million new net accounts addedOut of these, 400 million were consumer active accounts and 35 million were active merchant accounts\n* 16% increase in number of transactions to 22.3 billion\n* 9% total payment volume increase to $1.36 trillion on a spot basis so basically without adjusting for any forex changes.\n\nThe family of PayPal brands includes Braintree, Chargehound, Honey, Venmo and others so the company has a very strong brand presence. I keep seeing an ad for Honey almost every single day, I think the other brands are more US-focused (I'm UK-based), but the gist of it is that PayPal is becoming more popular, more established. [Recently, PayPal added more features to its payment solutions for small businesses.](https://investor.pypl.com/news-and-events/news-details/2023/PayPal-Adds-New-Features-to-Its-Complete-Payments-Solution-for-Online-Small-Businesses/default.aspx) The main change was increasing the range of payment options for customers by including Apple Pay along with saving payment options and others.\n\n# Competition\n\nWhen it comes to mobile payments, PayPal competes with the likes of Google Pay, Cash App, Zelle, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Venmo although Venmo is actually owned by PayPal. They all have some pros and cons. However, PayPal appears to have the best international payment support. PayPal owns Xoom which allows users to send payments to users in 131 countries without the recipient needing an app or a smartphone. The recipient can just pick up the payment at their local bank. PayPal also allows you to send money to people in over 200 countries worldwide as long as they also have the app. PayPal is also ahead of the competition when it comes to web and website payments since you can complete the payment by using any web browser. Doesn't matter if it's Firefox, Chrome or Safari. However, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google Pay can be used with smart watches which are becoming more and more popular.\n\n***US market***  \nIn fact, this may be one of the reasons why Apple Pay is the most widely used mobile payment service in the US. 43.9 million people report using it at least once followed by Starbucks with 31.2 million. Yes, Starbucks, I know, I'm surprised as well, but it seems to be a popular method of payment in the US. Google Pay follows with 25 million users and Samsung Pay with 16.3 million users. Again, this is in the US.\n\n***Worldwide***  \nIn terms of total mobile payment users worldwide, you have AliPay and WeChat Pay with 650 and 500 million users respectively, followed by Apple Pay with 507 million, Google Pay with 421 million and PayPal with 377 million. Venmo has 52 million, but it counted separately. If you combine the two since Paypal owns Venmo, Paypal comes ahead of Google Pay with 429 million users. Plus, AliPay and WeChat Pay are pretty much the status quo in China, but they are not that big outside of China. In fact, I'm not sure you can get them outside of China unless you are a Chinese national. Essentially, Google Pay, Apple Pay and Paypal are the big international names. Now, Google and Apple have a big advantage because they obviously produce their own phones, they have iOS and Android and they pretty much come with built-in Apple and Google Pay. They also have the smart watches which integrate with these payment apps.\n\n***Total Payment Volume competition***  \nNow, it would be really good if we could see the official total payment volume through these apps and compare it with Paypal. It could be the case where because the payment apps are installed by default, it seems they have a large userbase, but in reality users don't use them as much as Paypal or they just use them for small purchases. [The closest stats I could find were in this article here](https://www.paymentsjournal.com/apple-pay-transaction-volume-news-creates-mixed-messaging/). The author claims that Apple Pay has a total transaction volume of $6 trillion whereas Google Pay had $2.5 trillion. However, these are not official statistics by either of these companies. There are also disagreements over what exactly constitutes an Apple Pay or Google Pay transaction. In most cases, people don't pay with the apps, they just use the wallet option to pay with their actual card instead of paying with the digital payment app. Again, we don't know the exact transaction volume and we can just speculate, but we can see why Apple and Google Pay are massive competitors to Paypal. Still, the good thing is that the market for mobile payment apps is growing fast worldwide. There are a lot more users left to capture and Paypal is in a good position to do that as one of the leading payment apps, but enough about operations.\n\n# Financials metrics\n\nWe know Paypal is big and we know it's not going anywhere. The company is a viable competitor to Google and Apple, but what are the financials of Paypal? Are they profitable? Are they efficient? What's the case here?\n\nTo answer these questions, I will look at Paypal's current and historical metrics and compare them to the company's peers in the Transaction and Payment Processing sector in the US. Quick note on the sector metrics. This sector is dominated by Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, Fiserv, Block and Fidelity National Information Services. These 6 companies make up 77% of the total revenue in this sector. Meanwhile, 18 of the 35 companies in the sector are losing money. Basically, take the sector data with some hint of salt. I want to provide some comparison for Paypal, but at the same time we have a duopoly of Visa and Mastercard at the top and a lot of new players at the bottom.\n\nOkay, so lets look at profitability. Paypal has a:\n\n* gross profit margin of 42.35% which is below its 5-year average of 45.79% and the sector median of 47.32%\n* net income margin of 8.79% is also below its 5-year average of 14.58%, but above the sector median of 0.57%\n* levered free cash flow margin stands at 12.1% compared to its 5-year average of 14.58% and the sector median of 4.73%\n* Return on Equity is decent at 11.5% compared to the 5-year average of 16.7% and the sector median of 11.05%\n\nOverall, Paypal is doing well. Their metrics have declined over the last few years which is worrying, but the change has not been that drastic \\[yet\\]. It's good to monitor these metrics of course because this could turn into a red flag if the trend continues.\n\n# Analyst Expectations\n\nDespite the above, analysts are expecting a steady growth in earnings per share over the next few years. The consensus is:\n\n* 18.33% in 2023\n* 15.28% in 2024\n* 13.07% in 2025\n\nIn fact, analysts have recently started revising their expectations up which is a good sign. Basically, the sentiment towards Paypal is improving after a year and a half of declining expectations. This type of expectations change often leads to a reversal in stock price so this is one reason why I am turning bullish on Paypal.\n\nPaypal has historically shown really good growth in revenue and earnings. Their compounded annual revenue growth is 17% since 2013 with their revenue going from $6,727 billion in 2013 to $27,518 billion in 2022. Their compounded annual earnings growth is 10.9% with earnings growing from $955 million in 2013 to $2.42 billion in 2022. By the looks of it, this type of growth can be sustained for at least another few years.\n\n# Valuation\n\nThis is really, really good, mainly because the stock has lately been priced as a value stock. Paypal has:\n\n* adjusted PE ratio of 18.15 compared to the 5-year average of 41.72.\n* adjusted forward PE ratio of 15.34 compared to the 5-year average of 37.94\n* price-to-earnings growth ratio of only 1.1 compared to the 5-year average of 2\n* relatively low forward price-to-book of 3.74 compared to the 5-year average of 8.1\n* forward price-to-cash-flow of 11.84 compared to their 5-year average of 27.4\n\nThe way I see it, there are 2 reasons for the low valuation.\n\nOne, Paypal had a massively inflated stock price in 2021. Typically, you see a corresponding massive drop in price after this type of jump in valuation. Overreaction in one direction leads to overreaction in the opposite direction, a bit like a pendulum. This creates an amazing buying opportunity and I think we are seeing this right now.\n\nThe second reason for the low valuation could be that investors have different expectations to analysts. Even though the analysts expect a steady growth in earnings and profits, maybe investors don't see it that that way. Maybe there are some risk factors that analysts are overlooking. That's valid. Looking at Paypal's annual report, we can see a lot of factors that the company identifies. Cybersecurity is a crucial one, increasing competition is another. You also have legislation and compliance risk, you have risk to do with credit, third parties and so on. A lot of these are just regular day-to-day business threats that a financial processing company faces.\n\nThe main risk in my eyes is the increasing competition from Google and Apple. However, Paypal has some advantage there because it is mainly a financial company. Google and Apple have other more important business units and I think that Google Pay and Apple Pay are not as important to these companies as their core businesses. In comparison, payments and transactions are Paypal's core business. Cryptocurrency is also a growing risk, but I don't think it poses that big of a threat to Paypal right now. Maybe in 5 years or so. However, Paypal has been active in allowing users to buy, sell and transfer cryptocurrencies. Plus, users can actually use Paypal to pay in crypto although there are improvements that can be made there.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nOverall, I think that **we currently have a good bullish argument for Paypal**. The valuation is really cheap. We are seeing some of the lowest prices since December 2018. Even the company itself has committed to buying back a lot of shares because of the cheap price. In 2022, Paypal bought back $4.2 billion worth of shares or about 80% of their free cash flow. The management has said that they think share buybacks are an excellent way to spend their capital and I agree. They estimate that 75% of the free cash flow in 2023 will go towards share repurchases. In my opinion, this will create bullish pressure for the company. It will reduce the floating stock, it will increase ownership for existing shareholders and it will boost metrics. In terms of target price, the analyst consensus right now is $103.4 dollars or about a 38% upside on the current price of $75. I think that's a reasonable target for the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nWhat do you think? Is Paypal a good purchase right now? Have I missed any important details about their business?", "post URL info": ["https://investor.pypl.com/news-and-events/news-details/2023/PayPal-Adds-New-Features-to-Its-Complete-Payments-Solution-for-Online-Small-Businesses/default.aspx)", "https://www.paymentsjournal.com/apple-pay-transaction-volume-news-creates-mixed-messaging/)."], "author": "TheNewbieInvestor", "ups": "2", "downs": "0", "number of comments": "1", "comments": ["Ebay announced their intention of stopping Paypal as a mode of payment on their site in, I think, July 2023.\nI am not familiar with any announcement they've rescinded this decision.

That's despite headlines that it adds to an already complicated outlook for rate hikes, creating upside risks for inflation and Fed policy. But the bank sees it differently. Bofa thinks Opec's production cuts should create a small upside risk to inflation and a small downside risk to growth.

The company also offers various banking and loan-related services.\n\nCash App revenues come mainly from fees charged to users when using the Cash App card or when buying Bitcoin. Block also makes money from its Buy Now Pay Later program.\n\nIn spite of strong revenue growth, the company has failed to increase adjusted EBITDA noticeably. This can be attributed in part to impairment losses of Bitcoin holdings and increased marketing costs associated with its BNPL product.\n\nNonetheless, I believe SQ stands to benefit strongly from the coming crypto bull market, and has a lot of room for expansion in terms of increasing user profitability.\n\n## Block is Crypto First\n\nOne of the best things about Block is that it has made it very clear to users and investors that it is a crypto-friendly company. This is mainly due to the fact that Jack Dorsey, the CEO, is a firm believer in cryptocurrencies.\n\nBlock has a lot more exposure to crypto and Bitcoin than people think. On top of being one of the main platforms for buying/selling Bitcoin, SQ has a Bitcoin hardware wallet in the works. The company aims to make self-custody more accessible to everyone, a noble and hopefully lucrative endeavour.\n\nThough Block does also produce ASICs graphics cards, it is important to note that this initiative is mainly about creating a decentralized mining system by empowering the people rather than making profits.\n\nThe key thing to understand here is that SQ is positioning itself for a Bitcoin-centric future. So what could this future look like?\n\n## What to expect?\n\nWith the current financial turmoil going on, a company like SQ willing to integrate Bitcoin into its operations has more potential than ever.\n\nThe current issues created by higher bond yields are not limited to Silicon Valley Bank ($SIVBQ). Most of the US financial system is in a similar situation. In fact, Moody\u2019s has already cut down its rating of the US banking system. Ultimately, the only way out of this situation will be to monetize the financial system\u2019s losses, which could lead to a significant devaluation of the dollar in this already inflationary environment.\n\nThis is no longer speculation, but reality, with QE back on the table, and a flight into Bitcoin already underway. Most of the US ramps into crypto have shut down, like Silvergate ($SI), Signature ($SBNY), and SVB, and others are under attack, with Coinbase ($COIN) being threatened with SEC fines just last week.\n\nSQ not only remains one of the final ways to get money into Bitcoin but could also become a significant player in enabling Bitcoin use in actual day-to-day economic transactions.\n\nSQ is already a well-established supplier of hardware and software for business sales systems. On the other hand, it has a strong presence with consumers through Cash App, with over 50 million users, and it has already integrated a way for users to buy Bitcoin. Add to that a hardware wallet, which will enable completely secure storage of Bitcoin, and you have all the right ingredients for mass Bitcoin adoption.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nWith that said, the technical picture for SQ suggests we could still see a deeper correction in the medium term.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/fwpykrtxb1ta1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ee966f608ec3e213191b7318989a16cc914a72bf)\n\nUltimately, I see the rally SQ made into $300 as a completed impulse in a large wave I, and this puts us now in wave II, of which have only completed the first left down. The A wave bounced exactly off the 50% retracement at $49. It is currently in a B wave bounce, though with the current sell-off, I am seeing pre-market due to the short report, this correction could be over soon.\n\nOnce this B wave completes, a final sell-off into the 61.8% retracement at $32 should ensue.\n\n## Takeaway\n\nIn conclusion, I am encouraged by Block and Jack Dorsey\u2019s commitment to empowering crypto payments. Furthermore, the company has a solid business model with plenty of room to grow, and I am adding this to the LT crypto stock portfolio.\n\nThis is just one of many exciting crypto stocks you can buy right now!", "post URL info": ["https://preview.redd.it/sgq0ikvsb1ta1.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6afc9478fcd34a31dc6970cd31a098ea46b53083)", "https://preview.redd.it/fwpykrtxb1ta1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ee966f608ec3e213191b7318989a16cc914a72bf)"], "author": "Playful-Ad6687", "ups": "0", "downs": "0", "number of comments": "1", "comments": ["The reduced value stems from a possible incoming recession.

Top-line trends have obscured the growth story that is DFIN\u2019s software segment. The stock performance has closely followed the reported revenue number: spiking in 2021 due to increased Transactional business (fueled by the capital markets frenzy) but declining by 12% in 2022. Software revenue appears to be flat in this period. In actuality, while sales of the transaction-driven Venue software product (Virtual Data Rooms for due diligence) were down 32%, the remaining compliance-driven (recurring) software portfolio has been steadily growing.\n\nApplying a modest 5.5x EV/Revenue multiple to the recurring software segment (21% of total revenue) would yield a valuation of $1bn (DFIN is currently valued at $1.3bn). Workiva, the closest segment competitor, is valued at 8.9x revenue, which has similar sales growth but negative EBITDA margins. 5.5x is also especially conservative: the median public SaaS company with mild growth (15-30%) is trading at 5.0x, with a -25% EBITDA margin.

The company\u2019s solution span use cases across the product life cycle, from design to mass production to aftermarket operations, and they cover an array of industries, including automotive, aerospace, healthcare and dental machine design etc.    (Source: Desktop Medal Website)  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3mrca3e12osa1.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c63b19bb815e052a9e6c8572b3e593ca237dd9cb\n\nThe Bulls: \n\n1.\tIn February, the company has announced to reduce its workforce by around 15%, which would save $50M in 2023 \n\n2.\tIn the latest financial report released in March 1st, The company generated $60 million in revenue in the 4th quarter, beat Wall Street expectation of $54 million. The total revenue for 2022 is 209 million for the year, up 86% form USD 112 million year over year.      \n\nThe Bears: \n\n1.\tAlthough the company has revenue growth, its net income is still negative, with -$740 million for the year, which is expanded compare with -$240 million last year. Moreover, the gross profit margin has declined form 16.3% to 7.2%. \n\n2.\tGiving new guidance for 2023, Desktop Metal predicted that sales might grow to $210 million (up 0.5% year over year) - $260 million (up 24% year over year). Comparing with Wall Street expectation of $260 million in sales this year, it seems that the sales boom in 2022 is not sustainable this year. So is the stock price jump in the past 2 days. \n\n3.\tInsider is selling: as no one will sell stock at a low price, the selling action of the company executives may show they are not expecting the stock to go up even more.   \n\nIn a word, 3D Printing is the 4th industrial revolution and DM is one of the key player in the market, which both guru Chamath Palihapitiya and Cathy Woods has invested in. As the company has not turn profit yet, the stock price would be quite volatile and investing in stock will be risky. In terms of valuation, PS is 3.07, and PB is 1.23, and Morningstar gives Fair Value of $4.54 with extreme high uncertainty, and the best buying price is less than $1.68.

In this gripping exploration, we'll delve into the fascinating world of \"meme stocks\" and the investors who profit from them. We'll examine the strategies employed by these modern-day market mavens and discuss the potential risks and rewards of this new investment frontier. So, strap in and prepare for a wild ride through the stock market's digital landscape!\n\nThe Birth of Meme Stocks\n\nMeme stocks emerged as a powerful force in the stock market around the early 2020s. It all began when a group of retail investors on social media platforms like Reddit's WallStreetBets started rallying around specific stocks, causing their share prices to skyrocket. Some of the most famous examples include GameStop (GME), AMC Entertainment (AMC), and BlackBerry (BB).\n\nThe Power of the Crowd\n\nMeme stocks exemplify the impact of collective decision-making and the influence of online communities on the stock market. A single post on Reddit or Twitter can quickly snowball into a full-fledged movement, driving up the stock price and generating buzz. This collective action can sometimes challenge the conventional wisdom of Wall Street analysts and even force hedge funds to rethink their strategies.\n\nStrategies of Meme Stock Investors\n\nSocial media monitoring: Meme stock investors constantly monitor platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and TikTok for trending stocks and hot tips. They look for early signs of a potential meme stock candidate and try to jump on the bandwagon before it goes viral.\n\nSentiment analysis: Investors use tools like sentiment analysis algorithms to gauge the overall mood surrounding a particular stock. This helps them determine whether the stock has the potential to become a meme stock.\n\nShort-term trading: Meme stocks are highly volatile, and their rapid rise often leads to equally dramatic falls. Investors who successfully profit from meme stocks tend to focus on short-term trading strategies, such as day trading or swing trading, to capitalize on the rapid price fluctuations.\nRisks and Rewards\n\nInvesting in meme stocks can be a high-risk, high-reward game. On the one hand, early investors can make substantial profits when a stock goes viral. On the other hand, the volatile nature of these stocks means that latecomers can potentially suffer significant losses.\n\nNavigating the Meme Stock Phenomenon\n\nDo your due diligence: Always research a company's fundamentals and financial health before investing, regardless of its meme stock status.\n\nSet realistic expectations: Understand that the rapid rise of a meme stock may not be sustainable in the long term. Be prepared for price fluctuations and have a clear exit strategy.\n\nDiversify your portfolio: Don't put all your eggs in the meme stock basket. Diversify your investments to reduce the overall risk.\nStay informed: Keep an eye on social media trends, but also follow reputable financial news sources to stay updated on the broader market.\n\nIn conclusion, the world of meme stocks has forever changed the investing landscape. Social media platforms have given rise to a new breed of investors who are shaping the market in unprecedented ways. While meme stocks can offer significant rewards, they also come with their fair share of risks. By understanding the dynamics of this phenomenon and making informed investment decisions, you can navigate the thrilling world of meme stocks and potentially profit from the opportunities they present.", "post URL info": [], "author": "marsh20202020", "ups": "0", "downs": "0", "number of comments": "5", "comments": ["People should avoid meme stocks and invest is something more robust, such as investments in Banks\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.", "This article can be summed up with one of its own sentences, \"Don't put all your eggs in the meme stock basket.\" Following meme stocks is a valid strategy, but like all strategies, one needs to understand what's going on before jumping in.", "Profit?

Unlike last week, when the majors were all generally sitting at or just under reistance levels, this week leaves us with each index sitting at different technical levels.  IWM is nearest to support, SPY is floating mid-channel, and QQQ remains nearest to resistance.  If IWM is acting as a leading indicator, this could suggest a bigger breakdown is coming, but price would need to break back inside its bear channel and move down to retest the October 2022 pivot low.  Conversely, IWM could bounce, allowing QQQ to put in a bull flag in the upper range of its channel, and SPY to actually reach its channel ceiling (as QQQ already has).  Time will tell, but in my opinion probabilities are favoring a more bearish move; as a result, I continue to take shorts (or long inverse ETFs) & buy puts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SPY**:  Potential 'lower-high' put in this week, as price failed to get above the consolidation zone from late January - early February 2023.  Right now, the 418.31 double top is still likely a major resistance level, but if price consolidates at current levels then the convergence of TLs at 430 is definitely a major level to watch.  That said, if this week did put in a lower-high, then price will likely head back to the parallel channel floor, which is the level to watch on the support side.  With price floating mid-channel like it is, probabilities could go either way from here: macro remains decidedly bearish, but on the shorter micro timeframe, probabilities are neutral to slightly bearish due to that potential lower-high.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0a0eg4sivgsa1.jpg?width=2390&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3e7c9ab7f85bd5af00f78f62029b24291a575071\n\n**QQQ**:  The ceiling of the upsloping parallel channel held beautifully.  Tuesday price hit the ceiling around the market open, then Wednesday & Thursday price pulled back right into the double top from early February 2023...and ended the week bouncing off this level.  Sizeable green candle Thursday, but, very light volume so the candle should not be 'trusted.'  Regardless, price is floating in the upper range of the channel so probabilities could go either way.  The channel floor & ceiling are the major support & resistance levels though, and the micro trend is bullish despite the macro trend remaining bearish.  If price puts in a bull flag between that previous double top & the channel ceiling, then next major resistance is 334.42 the August 2022 double top.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/of3t9gxeugsa1.jpg?width=2393&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2f2678db6bd69743c598a0a990aa5c002beb5d35\n\n**IWM**: As probabilities suggested, 180 was major resistance; price again rejected the upsloping TL of the parallel channel it had been trading in since the October 2022 pivot low.  That TL remains the level to watch on any upside move.  The bear channel ceiling continues to offer support, but major support remains the  162.50 October 2022 pivot low.  Between those two aforementioned TLs, a bearish megaphone could be forming off the sharp, early March down move.  Unless price can re-enter & stay within that upsloping parallel channel, both the macro & micro trends here are bearish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wwbbr6mrsgsa1.jpg?width=2391&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c94ed599f491569c2221781d856c7d49761ab621\n\nMy swing trading account is curently 70% invested.\n\n**This week**, I closed 1x position -- **AMGN Calls +1.81%**  \\--not much, but, at one point this trade was down --60%.

With resilient operations, it\u2019s no mystery why analysts favor each stock strongly.**  \n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell when the pain that tech companies are facing will subside until I have more clarity on where rates are headed. Regardless, it\u2019s encouraging that big tech stocks have regained leadership. Even in the face of the regional banking turmoil, tech stocks have helped lift the S&P 500 (**SPX**) over the last few weeks.\n\nTherefore, in this piece, I\u2019ll use TipRanks\u2019 Comparison Tool to analyze three high-quality tech stocks with Strong Buy consensus ratings from analysts. With solid upside potential ahead for each stock, they\u2019re worth looking into.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/xnhrhnmfzesa1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=229ac9d47fd41df56c6cd0268b3db7a24c7366b4)\n\n## Block ($SQ)\n\nBlock is a fallen fintech innovator headed by Jack Dorsey, which is down 76% from its peak. Recently, the stock fell under pressure due to a short report issued by Hindenburg. The allegations in the report are serious, and while Block fired back quickly, it may still be too early to draw any conclusions. If the allegations are true, Block stock could crumble to multi-year lows. Fortunately, many analysts aren't buying the Hindenburg allegations, and Bank of America and Citigroup are sticking with their Buy recommendations. Despite the new pressures, I remain bullish.  \n\n## ServiceNow ($NOW)\n\nServiceNow is up 22% year-to-date due to the bounce-back in high-multiple tech, and was recently upgraded by Baird's Rob Oliver to $548 from $475. Oliver views ServiceNow's offering as \"less discretionary\" and believes it will hold up as the economic tides go out. Shares have climbed higher in recent months, now up around 40% off their lows. At 13.2 times price-to-sales, NOW stock is pricier than the software industry average, but it may be worth the premium if it can prove its resilience through harsh times.  \n\n## CrowdStrike ($CRWD)\n\nCrowdStrike is a cybersecurity software developer down 52% from its 2021 peak. Analysts are bullish on the stock, as it trades at a discount to the IT services and consulting industry average of 19.6 times. Layoffs and cost cuts could continue, but don't expect demand for CrowdStrike's Falcon cloud-based solution to sink. AI has been the tech trend of the year, and breach prevention is one market that stands to benefit from continued AI advancements. CrowdStrike has also been making small deals, many of which stand to add to its arsenal. \n\n[https://www.tipranks.com/news/article/3-strong-buy-rated-tech-stocks-worth-your-attention](https://www.tipranks.com/news/article/3-strong-buy-rated-tech-stocks-worth-your-attention)", "post URL info": ["https://preview.redd.it/xnhrhnmfzesa1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=229ac9d47fd41df56c6cd0268b3db7a24c7366b4)", "https://www.tipranks.com/news/article/3-strong-buy-rated-tech-stocks-worth-your-attention](https://www.tipranks.com/news/article/3-strong-buy-rated-tech-stocks-worth-your-attention)"], "author": "Oli_01", "ups": "7", "downs": "0", "number of comments": "1", "comments": ["[deleted]", "I will be messaging you in 8 months on [**2023-12-31 00:00:00 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2023-12-31%2000:00:00%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/12edbl3/3_strong_buyrated_tech_stocks_worth_your_attention/jfjfjjx/?context=3)\n\n[**CLICK THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FStockMarket%2Fcomments%2F12edbl3%2F3_strong_buyrated_tech_stocks_worth_your_attention%2Fjfjfjjx%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202023-12-31%2000%3A00%3A00%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%2012edbl3)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|"]}

These notorious halts have been evident in stocks such as $GME, $AMC, $APE, $MULN, $TSLA, $BBIG & so many others. The reason these Halts only seem to happen when retail investors stand to benefit from price action is that these halts and the policies & rules these abide by were designed by a committee whom is comprised by individuals who know how to abuse the system.\n\nRobert Books is LULD Chair, but he works for CBOE Global Markets in the Market Structure & Functionality Group. Hubert De Jesus is the Managing Director, and Global Head of Market Structure & Electronic Trading at BlackRock, yet he\u2019s on the LULD Advisory Committee. Kimberly Russel, acting Vice President at State Street Global Advisors is on the LULD Advisory Committee. Matthew Lavicka, the managing director in the equities division of Goldman Sachs is on the LULD Advisory Committee. Joseph Mecane of Citadel Securities is Head of Execution Services at Citadel, Chairman of the Nasdaq Quality of Markets Committee, serves on the FINRA Board of Governors, the Nasdaq Exchange Board, and the Board of Trustees for the Museum of American Finance. Ovidio Montemayor is the Managing Director of Trading Operations, Order Routing, & Securities Lending at TD Ameritrade. Marc Rosenthal of Virtu Financial is the Executive Vice President of Strategy & Corporate Development. He was previously Managing Director at Morgan Stanley\u2019s Equity Division & senior member of the electronic trading management team. Andrew Upward of Jane Street is an ETF Strategist, former Head of Market Structure at Weeden & Co., & Market Structure Analyst at Rosenblatt Securities. These individuals are all in charge of making decisions that ultimately impact the market at large. How can we entrust the governance of financial markets to those who know best how to abuse the financial markets? The SEC will never enact change because it is governed by people who have no interest in changing things whilst they stand to benefit from the current market structures.\n\nAs experts in their respective fields, these people can introduce processes, procedures, policies, systems, modes, rules, conventions, and even shape laws/legislation used by the governing bodies of finance, ex. (The SEC, DTCC, FTC, FINRA, ETC). The same is true for the Board of Directors at the DTCC. Here\u2019s a link to the official website. We need an independent investigation by the FBI and/or the Department of Justice to impose hard prison time on market manipulators, no more slap on the wrist fines. Fines do very little to dissuade market manipulators from partaking in wall street crime. If I rob a bank for $60 MILLION and the SEC, the DTCC, FINRA, or any other government agency hits me with a $6 MILLION fine, guess what? I'm hitting another bank the next day.\n\nIf I see white collar criminals going to PRISON for LONG prison sentences, THEN I'd think twice about committing fraud and market manipulation. Institutions are not individual people, and I'm sick of seeing \"companies\" like Goldman Sachs, Virtu, Bank of America, Credit Suisse, and other firms, hedge funds, & banks amongst others receive *fines* but not executives going to prison, or getting light prison sentences. If you invest in the stock market at *ANY* capacity, this concerns *YOU*. Get vocal! Write to someone who can enact change! Otherwise you might as well take your hard earned money and burn it all.\n\n[https://www.luldplan.com/committee](https://www.luldplan.com/committee)\n\n[https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board](https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The SEC entrusts market regulation to the very people exploiting it.

However, you have yet to address the key issues here. Policies, procedures, protocols, rules, conventions, & laws & legislation introduced & enacted by bad actors in financial sectors is not so farfetched, especially when you consider that retail investors are not the only ones who overleverage themselves.\n\nWhy did Silicon Valley Bank fall? What about Signature Bank? Please tell me how Credit Suisse was a conspiracy? Or do you think that was the fault of investors as well?\n\nLimit Up Limit Down Halts were *created* by an Advisory Committee, even if they *function* automatically. Both statements can be true and are not mutually exclusive. The fact remains that this committee created this rule that governs all stocks in the stock market. However, these individuals work hand in hand *with* if not *for* institutions that benefit from these rules and stack the deck against the average retail investor.\n\n[https://news.investorturf.com/nasdaq-ceos-trading-halt-proposal-raises-concerns-among-investors](https://news.investorturf.com/nasdaq-ceos-trading-halt-proposal-raises-concerns-among-investors)\n\nGo ahead and tell me that these halts are for investor protection. Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman *admitted* that Halts were specifically made to help investors to \"recalibrate their positions\". Why have certain stocks triggered halts on the way up and not in the way *down*? Certain stocks have seen falls as large as 20%, yet those LULD halts are nowhere to be seen.

There are companies out there with Quarter over Quarter of improving Fundamentals that *STILL* get negative reviews. It's not a conspiracy theory, it's an *AGENDA*.\n\nRecently Benzinga published an erroneous, libelous, and potentially criminal tweet on social media stating that a certain company had been acquired by Amazon. This impacted stock price materially. Anyone can make a mistake, understandably. But Benzinga didn't correct this until called out by that company's CEO. It's even more suspect when you realize that Benzinga CEO Jason Raznick owns a hedge fund, Accretive Capital LLC, who is shorting the company they published false news about. Tell me it's a \"conspiracy\". Maybe you're just uninformed about what's truly happening, and that's fine. But to speak about a subject you're poorly informed about reflects poorly on *you.*", "It's deflection! Instead of adding to it they just roll into parts that are being made more clear everyday!

What I mean is this - I guess you could say my strategy in the market is dumb. That's OK. I don't mind. I actually don't have good income from my job.

Then each day the managers would see what \u201ccould\u201d happen to them.\n\n\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nI think I would be happy if we just retroactively make them pay up to  10 years of bonuses and 50% of their salaries if the risk they took sinks the bank.\n\nThese assholes operate like they are hedge funds but FED has to come to their rescue when things go south.", "I agree with a lot of what you\u2019re saying about transparency & the solution of 100% reserve banking (which can work, funds just need to be allocated into either a CD type deposit, or a non-interest bearing checking account.  The latter being always accessible & funded by a small monthly fee, the former inaccessible without penalty or lack of interest.  Nothing could be lent that isn\u2019t in existence, on deposit.) \n\nThe only thing I\u2019d switch is replacing the word fed with congress & keeping all decisions to \nIncrease or decrease the money supply transparent & televised.  In general and outside times of war & catastrophe, the money supply would only increase with the population size.  There is no reason for the fed to exist, they do not contribute capital, they invent funds and we pay them interest on it. Similar economists & PHD\u2019s on finance can advise the congress on their thoughts. However, this group must be unaffiliated in anyway with private or central banks.\n\nYes the fed has no liquidity problem, because they can always create more.  Unfortunately when they do that, inflation happens & sometimes it really is terrible.  Having any private party in charge of our money supply is giving them absolute power over politicians, all the way up; more so than individual banks donating money to a re-election campaign.  Since nobody knows who actually owns the fed (complete lack of transparency), other than the fed, it\u2019s impossible to prove they haven\u2019t profited more than anyone off any decisions they\u2019ve made.  Every president who\u2019s tried to do away with private central banks has been eliminated, & that\u2019s a hell of a coincidence & a sign they probably profit quite a bit by holding the reigns.  By combining fractional reserve lending, and a private central bank that can \u201cprint\u201d money out of nothing, at our interest paid to them, we have effectively had our country stolen.", "I prefer FED compared to politicians any day. Problem is FED in bed with bankers, that link needs to be broken. Of course, FED should be 100% transparent and should be reporting to congress. I am not comfortable with our ignorant politicians using monetary policy to win elections.\n\nNobody should be able to make profit by handling deposits and lending, there is no need for profits there, it can all be managed on auto pilot, so it can be handled by a branch of FED.\n\nBankers can go fuck themselves all they want in investment banking like hedge funds do, I am just tired of them coming with a bowl when things go tits up.", "Thing is, the FED ARE bankers, most notable, JP Morgan himself, turns out when he died, it was disclosed that he only owned about 20% of his companies, the remainder was owned by the Rothschilds, who own the Bank of England & gained control of it by manipulating the sale & purchase of English war bonds after the battle of Waterloo. It\u2019s all out there, you\u2019re giving up bankers for BANKERS by opting for the fed.", "FED does not work on for profit basis. They are a counter weight to the private for profit enterprise, which IMO does not work correctly since investment banking was mixed with traditional banking.\n\nFED has no business other than keeping the economy stable by balancing employment and inflation, as they have been doing to the best of their ability.", "No, Fed does not work on a for profit basis, but the OWNERS of the fed (again, who are not disclosed as it\u2019s private, could and likely also do own, say a for profit bank or two & large investment firms) can absolutely manipulate advance knowledge of the shrinking or growing money supply.  We DO know that one of the original owners was JP Morgan.  Are you telling me he never turned a profit, or that his involvement in the FED never helped him do so?  Even Woodrow Wilson, who was president when & helped them to come into existence, deeply regretted doing so by his second term.  \n\n\u201c\u2018GIVE me control of a nation\u2019s money supply, and I care not who makes its laws.\u2019  So said Mayer Amschel Rothschild, founder of the Rothschild banking dynasty.\u201d - Well know quote sourced from The Economist."]}

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite outperformed with a 0.76% gain to 12,087.96, boosted by a 3.78% rise in Google-parent Alphabet and a 2.55% rally in Microsoft shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched 2.57 points higher to 33,485.29 after losing more than 150 points at its session low.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 still lost 0.1% on the week, posting its first losing week in four. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1.1% this week, while the 30-stock Dow rose 0.6%.\n*****\n> The market remained volatile as the latest weekly jobless claims came in higher than expected, adding to recent signals that pointed to slowing job growth. The expansion in private payrolls was well below expectations in March, ADP said earlier this week. Meanwhile, the number of available positions fell below 10 million in February \u2014 a first in almost two years. Job cuts have also soared by nearly fivefold so far this year from a year ago.\n*****\n> Over the past several months, investors had cheered signs of economic cooling on the hope that it could push the Federal Reserve to change course on its interest rate hiking campaign. But they are now wondering if the central bank has gone too far in its bid to cool inflation, tightening the economy to the point of a recession.\n*****\n> \u201cThe Fed built a wall with interest rates and now the economy is running into it,\u201d said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group.\n*****\n> Thursday capped off a shortened trading week with the market closed for Good Friday. Investors will still closely monitor March jobs report Friday morning. Nonfarm payrolls have been showing solid growth despite layoffs across tech and financial sectors, but many believe the trend is poised to reverse soon.\n*****\n> Jobless claims data \u201clends credence to the idea that the Fed\u2019s rate hikes are beginning to cool down the labor market and slow down the economy,\u201d said Chris Zaccarelli, CIO at Independent Advisor Alliance. \u201cThe odds are much higher that it will cause a recession \u2013 and even a significant recession \u2013 than most people are currently willing to believe.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/SEGLNbJ.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fo5yQPQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fPkVoMv.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/QEz9Dtx.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/XEuYACg.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sEwCvmb.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/v4dVWOn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mgpvGP4.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xf4NxwM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6mxqzjG.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/XDwhUMv.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/3Oj5wvD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ccB4NYr.png))**\n\n\n*****\n\n> # A Big Win for the Bulls\n\n> \u201cWe may not know where we are going, but we better know where we stand.\u201d Howard Marks, Co-Founder of Oaktree Capital Management\n\n> A little-known technical indicator triggered in the first quarter, and it could bring smiles to the bulls. This one is known as the December Low indicator, and it is fairly straightforward: when the S&P 500 doesn\u2019t close beneath the December low close, good things have tended to happen the rest of the year. The opposite, of course, is when the December lows are violated in the first quarter. To refresh your memory, that is exactly what happened last year and was one subtle clue that the odds of a dicey rest of \u201922 had increased. Given that stocks didn\u2019t break their December low this year, this is one less worry for sure.\n\n> Interestingly, since 1950, stocks held above the December lows 36 times while they broke the lows 37 times. Talk about even Steven. Those are some pretty big sample sizes, and sure enough, the results are quite conclusive.\n\n> Those 36 times the December lows held? The full year was up an incredible 34 times and up an average of 18.6%. The times it failed? The full year was down 0.2% on average and higher less than a coin flip.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-170.png))**\n\n> If you wanted to investigate things closer, here are all 36 times it held above the December lows. I added what happened the rest of the year (so the next three quarters) as well, and once again, strong performance was quite normal. We get it. Anything could happen from here, but the truth is it would be quite abnormal to expect a massive bear market and a horrible year for stocks this year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-216.png))**\n\n> Here\u2019s the other side to things; what happened when the December low was violated? Once again, the full year and the next three quarters\u2019 returns were much different and weaker. Just a quick glance and some of the worst years ever saw the December lows broken. Years like \u201973, \u201974, the tech bubble, \u201908, and \u201922 all made this infamous list.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-32.png))**\n\n> Odds are, as you read this, I will be on a beach in the Turks and Caicos for Spring Break. (You caught me, I wrote this last week.) So as of right now, I\u2019m not overly concerned about this potentially bullish development; I\u2019m more into those fruity drinks with umbrellas in them, but once I get back home, you better believe this will be one that I\u2019ll be focusing on closely. Or, as Howard Marks said in the quote above, we don\u2019t know where we are going, but we do know we stand on potentially a better backdrop for stocks than most think.\n\n*****\n\n> # What Would Moses Do? Sell Passover\n\n> If Moses were trading stocks in the 21st Century, he would be wise to the seasonal cycles that move the markets year after year and know that Passover is the time to begin considering some portfolio spring cleaning.\n\n> The full Hebrew calendar trading strategy is \u201cSell Rosh Hashanah-Buy Yom Kippur-Sell Passover.\u201d Passover conveniently occurs in March or April, right near the end of our \u201cBest Six Months\u201d strategy and it\u2019s no coincidence that Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur fall in September and/or October, two dangerous and opportune months.\n\n> DJIA is up 81.8% of the time from Yom Kippur to Passover since 1990 with an average gain of 8.1%.On the flipside DJIA is up 62.5% from Passover to Yom Kippur with an average gain of only 1.2% (not shown). DJIA is up 10.3% since Yom Kippur 2022 as of today\u2019s close.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/6b4f5a23e2a700b4f1b69c4772c27a0d/6221a18ab8d65f26-74/s500x750/88f400f7009832321626c66eb9917ddbdb1e04db.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Claims Get Revised\n\n> Jobless claims were in focus this morning as seasonally adjusted initial claims were surprisingly high at 228K versus expectations of 200K. Previously, adjusted claims had consistently come in well below 200K with 10 readings below that level in the last 11 weeks. However, that large increase in the most recent week's data was matched with large revisions to the past couple of years' data as the BLS updated its seasonal adjustment methodology. The net impact of those changes was to redistribute claims throughout the year, revising up readings from Q1 and Q4 while Q2 and Q3 were revised down; total or average annual readings were not changed. As discussed in greater detail on the BLS website and we will review in more depth in tonight's Closer, there are two methods for seasonal adjustment: multiplicative or additive. Most of the time the claims data has used multiplicative seasonal factoring, but periods like the first year of the pandemic in which the indicator experiences unusually large level increases means an additive approach becomes more apt. This week, the BLS applied a new hybrid approach with additive factoring applied from early March 2020 through mid-2021 and multiplicative factoring for all other periods.\n\n> As shown below, that change back to multiplicative factoring resulted in some large revisions for initial claims over the past couple of years. In turn, that has dramatically changed the picture jobless claims have painted. Previously (red line in chart below) claims had been more or less trending sideways after bottoming around a year ago, but after these revisions (blue line) claims are trending upwards and bottomed this past September. In addition, the upward revision to 247K to the print from two weeks ago would mark the highest level since January 2022.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/040623-Claims-1a.png))**\n\n> As for the non-seasonally adjusted data, the story is much less noisy being unaffected by the aforementioned revisions. In other words, the overall picture for claims hasn't changed when looking at this series. Claims remain near historically healthy levels consistent with the few years prior to the pandemic. Granted, those are off the strongest readings from last year. At this point of the year, claims are also trending lower as could be expected based on seasonal patterns. The next couple of weeks may see claims move higher because of seasonality, though, that would likely prove to be a temporary bump in the road with claims resuming the trend lower through the late spring.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/040623-Claims-2.png))**\n\n> The revision likewise impacted continuing claims which rose to 1.823 million in the most recent week. That brings claims back up to the highest levels since December 2021 as they have risen sequentially for three weeks in a row.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/040623-Claims-3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Sentiment Back to Bullish\n\n> Sentiment saw a huge rebound this week based on the latest AAII survey. With the S&P 500 taking out early March highs late last week, bullish sentiment jumped 10.8 percentage points to 33.3%. Although there was a higher level of bullish sentiment as recently as February 16th, this week's increase was the largest WoW jump since June of last year. Even though a double-digit jump in bullish sentiment sounds significant, S&P 500 performance has been unremarkable following similar instances historically.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/040623-AAII-1.png))**\n\n> The rise in bullish sentiment borrowed almost entirely from those reporting as bearish. Bearish sentiment fell 10.6 percentage points down to 35%. That is the lowest reading since mid-February and the first double-digit drop since November.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/040623-AAII-2.png))**\n\n> The huge shift in favor of bulls this week resulted in the bull-bear spread narrowing to -1.7 points. That is the least negative reading in the spread since February when the bull-bear spread had broken a record streak of bearish readings.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/040623-AAII-3.png))**\n\n> As we noted last week, the AAII survey has been a holdout in showing more optimistic sentiment readings. Whereas other sentiment surveys like the NAAIM exposure index and the Investors Intelligence survey had essentially returned to historical averages, the AAII survey saw firmly bearish sentiment readings with a bull-bear spread of 1.6 standard deviations from its historical average as of last week. Given the quick turnaround this week, the AAII survey is no longer weighing on our Sentiment Composite as it moved back into positive territory indicating bullish sentiment for only the fourth week since the start of 2022.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/040623-AAII-5.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Looming Debt Ceiling Crisis 2011 D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3b0a1c1c80fb5d4161910d2bdbbc0ff5/0d80965d12d65f88-e3/s500x750/0b5e75b159b1121680e624e27df9ed1503de00f7.jpg))**\n\n> Let\u2019s not forget about the looming debt ceiling crisis. It is the same political set up as pre-election year 2011: Democratic President with a split Congress composed of a Democratic Senate majority and a Republican House majority.\n\n> The banking crisis may have been averted, at least for the time being. War in Ukraine drags on, but it still appears more like a protracted Cold War 2.0 scenario that the market has shrugged off. The earnings trough may indeed be ending. But! Let\u2019s be devil\u2019s advocates here.\n\n> The standoff in 2011 between the White House and House Republicans is eerily similar to what\u2019s developing in 2023. Markets topped out on the last trading day of April 2011 and entered a mini-bear phase with S&P down 19.4% on a closing basis before bottoming on October 3.\n\n> 2011\u2019s Worst Six Months were negative with the Dow down 6.7% and S&P down 8.1%. NASDAQ\u2019s Worst 4 Months July-October were down 3.2%. S&P finished the year essentially flat at -0.003%, Dow was up 5.5%, NASDAQ was off 1.8% on the year.\n\n> Uncertainty & headwinds can take a bite out of usual pre-election year gains. Heeding our Best 6 Months MACD Sell Signal when it triggers will likely be the prudent course of action. Review your portfolio. Get prepared to lock in these BSM gains, sell losers & tighten stops.\n\n***** \n\n> # 3 Reasons the Dollar Isn\u2019t Going Away Anytime Soon\n\n> There\u2019s always been talk about the U.S. dollar (USD) losing its dominant currency status globally, but lately, the chatter seems to have increased, especially since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which saw the US impose severe and expansive sanctions on Russia and Russian officials \u2013 enabled by the fact that the US treasury has jurisdiction over any transaction that involves the flow of USD. Rising tensions between the US and countries like China and Saudi Arabia have also raised concerns that these countries could price oil sales in Chinese yuan, denting the USD\u2019s dominance in the global oil trade. Never mind the fact that these talks have been going on for several years now.\n\n> The reality is this: the USD\u2019s dominant role is not going to end any time soon, especially since there\u2019s no good alternative. Let\u2019s walk through 3 reasons why, using some great data from a recent Federal Reserve report.\n\n> # 1. The World has confidence in the US, and thereby the U.S. dollar\n> This confidence doesn\u2019t come out of nowhere. As the Fed report notes, a key function of a currency is:\n\n> *\u201cA store of value which can be saved and retrieved in the future without significant loss of purchasing power.\u201d*\n\n> The US has the world\u2019s deepest and most liquid financial markets thanks to the following:\n\n> * The size of the US economy\n\n> * The strength of the US economy\n\n> * Open trade and capital flows, with fewer restrictions than a lot of other countries\n\n> * Strong rule of law, and property rights, with a history of enforcing them\n\n> This is why, despite the US making up just about 25% of the world economy, about 60% of global foreign currency reserves are denominated in USD. This has fallen from about 71% in 2000 but is still far ahead of other currencies, including the euro (21%), yen (6%), British pound (5%), and Chinese renminbi (2%). And the decline has been taken by various other currencies, as opposed to a single other one.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-05-USD-share-of-foreign-exchange-reserves-1202x1600.png))**\n\n> # 2. Network effects: The USD is dominant in trade invoicing and international finance\n> The USD is the world\u2019s most popular medium of exchange when it comes to trade, even beyond North & South America. Outside of Europe, where the euro is naturally dominant, more than 70% of exports are invoiced in US dollars. That\u2019s not likely to change anytime soon, especially with so many countries and companies involved.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-05-USD-share-of-export-invoicing-1201x1600.png))**\n\n> It shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that the popularity of the USD as a medium of exchange means it almost automatically becomes the dominant currency in international banking. Think of all the USD flowing across global banks as companies/customers make payments to each other. 60% of international foreign currency banking claims, i.e., bank deposits denoted in foreign currency, and loans are USD. That\u2019s been fairly stable since 2000 and has increased over the last few years. The euro is second but makes up just about 20%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-05-USD-share-of-international-banking-1202x1600.png))**\n\n> Network effects can be extremely hard to dislodge. It won\u2019t be easy to convince people across the world that they have to move their assets from the US dollar to another currency, let alone make the switch without any risk.\n\n> # 3. Most important reason is: The US is willing to maintain massive trade deficits\n> Here are a couple of statistics (as of Q4 2022)\n\n> * The rest of the world held about $7.4 trillion in US treasury securities\n\n> * The rest of the world held about $1 trillion in USD banknotes, which is about 46% of all USD banknotes out there\n\n> These are all \u201cliabilities\u201d of the US government, i.e., loans to the US government. But the real question is, why do foreigners hold so much of these in the first place?\n\n> Part of the answer lies in the first two reasons, but here\u2019s another big one. Foreigners sell a lot of stuff to Americans, about $3.3 trillion worth in 2022 alone. And they got USD in return for all that.\n\n> In an ideal world, foreigners would turn around and use those dollars to purchase stuff made in the USA, and trade would be \u201cbalanced\u201d.\n\n> But they don\u2019t. Instead, they bought about $2.1 trillion worth of goods from the US last year.\n\n> *Which means there was an extra $1.2 trillion that foreigners had. What do they do with it?*\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-05-USD-trade-deficit-revised-1202x1600.png))**\n\n> # The US is willing to supply the rest of the world with treasuries & banknotes\n\n> U.S. dollars can only buy goods and financial assets in the US. Foreigners could buy something in Europe or China, but they\u2019d have to convert the USD to euros/yuan first, and then someone else is left holding USD, and then they have to figure out what to do with those USD.\n\n> Instead, foreigners turn around and buy the safest, most liquid security in the world: US treasuries. Some of them also simply hold USD in cash (or deposits in their local bank). As I noted above, these are liabilities of the US government that the US is more than willing to issue. No other country, including the Eurozone, looks remotely capable or willing to do that anytime soon.\n\n> Which is why there are so many dollars and treasuries held by the rest of the world.\n\n> Could that change as countries decide to trade in their own currencies instead of the USD? Sure, but there\u2019s a problem.\n\n> Take Saudi Arabia and China, for example. The former could sell oil to China in yuan, but then the Saudis have to figure out what to do with those yuan. They\u2019d have to buy assets in China \u2013 but there aren\u2019t too many of that, especially Chinese government bonds.\n\n> China has capital controls as well. which means it may not be easy for the Saudis to pull their money out of China in the future, especially during a crisis when the Chinese want to limit outflows. Capital controls are how the Chinese control their currency, and it\u2019s hard to see them letting go of that lever anytime soon.\n\n> In sharp contrast, the Fed is willing to act as the global central bank, supplying dollar liquidity to the rest of the world when there\u2019s a crisis.\n\n> # The global economic model is unlikely to shift\n> The Chinese could decide they don\u2019t want extra dollars. So instead of selling all the extra stuff they produce to Americans, they could sell it to Europe, the rest of Asia, and Africa. But the thing is, those countries don\u2019t want too many of those goods either \u2013 because consumption is not as big a part of their economies (like the US).\n\n> Now, the Chinese could decide not to produce as much, but that is not a recipe for economic success.\n\n> Ideally, their own citizens would buy all the extra stuff they produce. But here\u2019s the problem: Chinese households don\u2019t earn enough to buy all those extra goods, and they save a lot more than Americans. They have to since there\u2019s nothing like Social Security or Medicare there. China then channels these savings into investment, which leads to a lot of buildings, infrastructure, and industrial production, which is what drives their economy.\n\n> The Chinese government could \u201cfix this,\u201d but that involves a significant shift in how their economy works \u2013 essentially redistributing national income away from the government and businesses to households. A massive political project that\u2019s unlikely to happen anytime soon.\n\n> It\u2019s not just the Chinese. It\u2019s the Germans, too, along with countries like Taiwan and South Korea, all of whom are reliant on exports to drive their economies.\n\n> A shift away from the economic model that these countries are reliant on to a model that is consumption-led is very difficult. As the previous chart shows, its actually gotten worse over the last few years as US trade deficits grew even more.\n\n> In fact, it would be better for US manufacturers if other countries do switch their economic model. Because that would mean they could buy more stuff that\u2019s made in the US. And trade would be more balanced.\n\n> In any case, there\u2019s no practical alternative to the U.S. dollar right now, and its dominance is likely to remain in place.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 7th, 2023** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvPc4gQCDx4))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 4/9/23** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> (*T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.*)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/6mxqzjG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/zFdpvau.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/3flg2rP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 2 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/ULX7sPM.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n> #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful 3-day weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket. :)", "post URL info": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/05/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**", "https://i.imgur.com/SEGLNbJ.png))**", "https://i.imgur.com/fo5yQPQ.png))**", "https://i.imgur.com/fPkVoMv.png))**", "https://i.imgur.com/QEz9Dtx.png))**", "https://i.imgur.com/XEuYACg.png))**", "https://i.imgur.com/sEwCvmb.png))**", "https://i.imgur.com/v4dVWOn.png))**", "https://i.imgur.com/mgpvGP4.png))**", "https://i.imgur.com/xf4NxwM.png))**", "https://i.imgur.com/6mxqzjG.png))**", "https://i.imgur.com/XDwhUMv.png))**", "https://i.imgur.com/3Oj5wvD.png))**", "https://i.imgur.com/ccB4NYr.png))**", "https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-170.png))**", "https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-216.png))**", "https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-32.png))**", "https://64.media.tumblr.com/6b4f5a23e2a700b4f1b69c4772c27a0d/6221a18ab8d65f26-74/s500x750/88f400f7009832321626c66eb9917ddbdb1e04db.jpg))**", "https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/040623-Claims-1a.png))**", "https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/040623-Claims-2.png))**", "https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/040623-Claims-3.png))**", "https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/040623-AAII-1.png))**", "https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/040623-AAII-2.png))**", "https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/040623-AAII-3.png))**", "https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/040623-AAII-5.png))**", "https://64.media.tumblr.com/3b0a1c1c80fb5d4161910d2bdbbc0ff5/0d80965d12d65f88-e3/s500x750/0b5e75b159b1121680e624e27df9ed1503de00f7.jpg))**", "https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-05-USD-share-of-foreign-exchange-reserves-1202x1600.png))**", "https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-05-USD-share-of-export-invoicing-1201x1600.png))**", "https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-05-USD-share-of-international-banking-1202x1600.png))**", "https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-05-USD-trade-deficit-revised-1202x1600.png))**", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvPc4gQCDx4))**", "https://i.imgur.com/6mxqzjG.png))**", "https://i.imgur.com/zFdpvau.png))**", "https://i.imgur.com/3flg2rP.png))**", "https://i.imgur.com/ULX7sPM.png))**", "https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l))"], "author": "bigbear0083", "ups": "3", "downs": "0", "number of comments": "0", "comments": []}

Welcome to the final trading day of this week and a fresh start!

S&P 500 futures were little changed, and Nasdaq-100 futures declined 0.2%.\n*****\n> Those moves come as investors digest new data that shows signs of a potentially weakening labor market. The ADP private payrolls report released Wednesday showed job growth slowed in March. Meanwhile, a Tuesday report showed that the number of available positions fell below 10 million in February \u2014 a first in almost two years.\n*****\n> Over the past several months, investors had cheered signs of economic cooling on the hope that it could push the Federal Reserve to change course on its interest rate hiking campaign. But they are now wondering if the central bank has gone too far in its bid to cool inflation, tightening the economy to the point of an economic slowdown or recession, said Rob Haworth, senior vice president and senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.\n*****\n> \u201cThe market is now becoming more concerned about the ensuing data as opposed to the Fed and trying to pick where the Fed is going to hit peak interest rates,\u201d Haworth said. \u201cPlenty of the Street is thinking, \u2018Recession, right?\u2019 The market has to start to price for that, because that\u2019s not where we\u2019re priced, so bad news definitely has to be bad news.\u201d\n*****\n> Investors will watch Thursday for jobless claims data for more insights into the strength of the labor market.

But before you start investing, it\u2019s important to understand the trends and patterns that drive the stock market. Analyzing stock market trends can help you make informed decisions about where and when to invest your money.\n\nOne of the most important things to look for when analyzing stock market trends is the overall direction of the market. This includes both short-term and long-term trends. Look for signs of whether the market is bullish, bearish, or somewhere in between. Pay attention to market indicators such as the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to look at the performance of specific sectors. Different sectors perform differently during different market conditions. For example, the technology sector may do well during a bull market, while the energy sector may do better during a bear market. By understanding how different sectors are performing, you can make decisions about what stocks to invest in.\n\nAnother important trend to watch for when analyzing stock market trends is the performance of individual stocks. Pay attention to the performance of stocks you\u2019re interested in investing in. Look at their performance over time, and pay attention to any news or announcements that could affect their performance. Also, keep an eye on the performance of other stocks in the same sector or industry. This can help you identify potential opportunities or risks.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s important to pay attention to economic indicators. Economic indicators provide insight into the overall health of the economy, and they can help you identify potential areas of opportunity or risk. Pay attention to indicators such as GDP growth, inflation, employment, and consumer spending. These can all provide valuable information about the overall direction of the economy and the stock market.\n\nWe at dynamic technologies develop Superfast API.

The stock market rally struggled Wednesday as weak economic data raised recession fears for a second straight session.  \n\nThe major indexes still don't look too bad, with the Nasdaq sliding but the Dow Jones rising.\n\nBut once again, declining stocks decisively beat winners. Once again, many of those losers fell hard. But on Wednesday, a lot of more of those big losers were leading stocks, such as **On Holding** ($**ONON**), **MarketAxess** ($**MKTX**) and **PagerDuty** ($**PD**). **C3.ai** ($**AI**) sold off for a second session, with the AI stock now staging a massive, outside week to the downside.\n\nOthers, including many chip names, declined solidly, now showing more chart damage after relatively modest retreats Tuesday.\n\n**Tesla** ($**TSLA**) skidded for a third straight day, triggering the automatic sell rule. \n\nMegacap techs such as **Apple** ($**AAPL**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**), Google parent **Alphabet** (**GOOGL**), **Meta Platforms** ($**META**) and **Nvidia** all fell.\n\nMeanwhile, bank stocks came under more pressure. **Western Alliance Bancorp** (**WAL**) plunged, leading a retreat in regional banks, though they pared losses in the afternoon. **Charles Schwab**hit a two-year closing low. While bank deposits may be relatively safe, the bigger issue now may be long-term bank profitability as well as lending curbs that rapidly slow the economy.\n\nMedical names are looking relatively strong, along with other defensive growth or defensive plays.\n\nPagerDuty stock, On Holding, Meta and Nvidia are on **IBD Leaderboard**. Microsoft and Google stock are on the **IBD Long-Term Leaders** list. \n\nDespite relatively benign action in the major indexes, the weakness in growth and other leading stocks is concerning. Investors should be looking to protect profits and cut losses.\n\n## Costco Sales Weak\n\nCostco same-store sales fell 1.1% in March vs. a year earlier, the first decline in nearly three years. U.S. comps slid 1.5%. Excluding gasoline and currency effects, comps rose 2.6% or 0.9% in the U.S. E-commerce comps tumbled 11.6%. COST stock fell modestly.\n\n## Dow Jones Futures Today\n\nDow Jones futures edged higher vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.2%.\n\nThe Labor Department will release weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. That follows unexpectedly weak February job openings and the March ADP Employment Report. Labor will release the March jobs report on Friday morning, but U.S. markets will be closed. \n\n## Stock Market Rally\n\nThe stock market rally had a generally negative session, despite the mixed action on the major indexes.\n\nThe ADP Employment Report showed private payrolls rose much less than expected in March, a day after a big drop in February job openings. The March ISM services index fell more than expected, signaling rapidly slowing growth.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2% in Wednesday's **stock market trading**. The S&P 500 index dipped 0.25%. The Nasdaq composite retreated 1.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave up 1%.\n\nU.S. crude oil prices dipped 0.1% to $80.61 a barrel.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield declined 5 basis points to 3.285%. That's the lowest point in nearly seven months. The 2-year Treasury yield sank 7 basis points to 3.76%, off 34 basis points in the past four sessions.\n\n## ETFs\n\nAmong growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ($**FFTY**) shed 1.9%, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF ($**BOUT**) gave up 0.65%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ($**IGV**) slipped 1.3%. Microsoft stock and a few other heavyweights dominate IGV, while more-speculative software names like PagerDuty suffered bigger losses. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([**SMH**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) gave up 1.75%, with NVDA stock a major holding.\n\nReflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF ($**ARKK**) slumped 3.6% and ARK Genomics ETF (**ARKG**) shed 1.8%. TSLA stock is the top holding across Ark Invest's ETFs. Some Ark funds also own PD stock.\n\nSPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (**XME**) retreated 1.15% and the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (**PAVE**) 1.7%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (**JETS**) and SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (**XHB**) descended 1.5%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (**XLE**) climbed 1.5% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (**XLV**) rallied 1.7% to its best level since Feb. 14.\n\n## Bank Stocks\n\nThe Financial Select SPDR ETF (**XLF**) edged down 0.1%, with SCHW stock a top 10 holding. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (**KRE**), which includes WAL stock, sank 1% but finished off lows.\n\nWestern Alliance stock plunged as much as 19.4% after releasing some financial metrics but not disclosing deposits. Shares came off their lows as the California-based bank disclosed deposits fell 11% on March 31 vs. the end of 2022, not as bad as some feared.

By 2022, this number is estimated to be around 6&#37;. Expectations are that VRBs share of global vanadium consumption will increase to 10&#37; in 2023.

Estimates reveal that an additional 2 GWhs of VRFBs will be installed in 2023 \u2013 a 2.5x increase over historic installations.\n\nVRFBs are responsible for a large share of global vanadium consumption than ever before.\n\nThe advent of VRFBs as a energy storage alternative is rapidly increasing its share to account for 10% of global vanadium consumption by 2023.\u00a0 Outside of China, investments and government support is also growing as long duration energy storage is becoming a key priority towards decarbonization.\n\nDemand from other key markets, including the steel, aerospace and chemical sectors, has also been stronger amid an increased inflationary environment.

Theyve been doing this for decades now. Usually they can scare investors away from a company with fake news and price suppression.\nFor gamestop they tried to do the same but no matter what the true gamestop believers never sold. \n\nAs for DRS, it allows you to have a stock certificate in your own name instead of through proxy through brokers. DRS also takes the certificate out of the DTCCs hands which allowed the hedge funds to find locates to shares they want to short. Gamestop shareholders already have 60% of the free float put of the DTCCs hands and in their own names. This has never been done before. Eventually we will DRS the entire free float and the shorts will not have enough shares to close their positions by buying back the real shares not to mention fake shares (estimated to be in the billions) that they printed. Then all that buying pressure and gamestop shareholders refusing to sell for anything under phone number prices or even selling at all will ultimately lead gamestops share price to millions potentially billions or even infinity dollars.

Experts generally say that as ovarian cancer is so rare, if there is an increased risk, it's very tiny.\n\nYou can read about some of these studies below:\n\n[https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/2008/10/05/talcum-powder-and-ovarian-cancer-whats-going-on/](https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/2008/10/05/talcum-powder-and-ovarian-cancer-whats-going-on/)\n\n[https://ovarian.org.uk/news-and-blog/news/talcum-powder-and-ovarian-cancer/](https://ovarian.org.uk/news-and-blog/news/talcum-powder-and-ovarian-cancer/)\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-health-talc-idUSKBN1Z61XE](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-health-talc-idUSKBN1Z61XE)\n\nDo the big cancer charities believe there is an elevated risk?

The ADP monthly payrolls showed that just 145,000 private-sector jobs were added in March, lower than estimates of 210,000 and down from 261,000 in February. The ISM Services report also showed decelerating business activity, as the index declined from 55.1 in February to 51.2 in March. Both news items follow a downbeat report on job openings yesterday, painting a picture that the labor market is finally cracking after a year of aggressive interest-rate hikes by the Fed. The increased concerns about a recession hit the tech sector particularly hard, as much of the sector has already seen slowing growth amid other headwinds. At the end of today's session, Appian stock was down 6.3%, Snowflake had lost 5.8%, and Shopify finished the session down 5%. \n\n## So what\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nAll three of these software stocks either trade at high valuations, are unprofitable, or are barely profitable, making them particularly vulnerable to a recession. Appian, which provides a low-code software platform to enterprise-level customers, said it expected growth to slow this year, due to demand headwinds.\u00a0\n\nAfter growing cloud subscription revenue by 32% in 2022, the company said growth in that category would slow to 24%-25% in 2023. It sees full-year revenue growth of just 13%-14%, compared to 27% growth in 2022.\n\nAppian is focused on narrowing its losses, and CEO Matt Calkins has said the company is prepared for a recession. But the stock is still vulnerable to a downturn. \n\nSnowflake, which is known as a cloud infrastructure company that provides data warehousing services, is one of the fastest-growing and highest-valued stocks in the software sector. Product revenue jumped 54% in its fourth quarter, and the company expects it to slow to 40% in 2023.\n\nWhile that's still a strong growth rate and Snowflake stock has fallen considerably from its peak, it still trades at a lofty price-to-sales ratio of 33. Since its business is consumption-based, it's likely to feel a direct impact from a slowdown in the economy.\n\nFinally, Shopify is the leader in e-commerce software, and e-commerce is largely based on discretionary retail spending, which also makes it sensitive to a recession. While it's possible that a recession could encourage more entrepreneurs to start online retail businesses, it's likely to dampen spending on the platform, which is a key revenue driver for the company. \n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/04/05/why-appian-snowflake-and-shopify-all-stumbled-toda/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/04/05/why-appian-snowflake-and-shopify-all-stumbled-toda/)", "post URL info": ["https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/04/05/why-appian-snowflake-and-shopify-all-stumbled-toda/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/04/05/why-appian-snowflake-and-shopify-all-stumbled-toda/)"], "author": "Ben_aid", "ups": "0", "downs": "0", "number of comments": "1", "comments": ["Surviorship...."]}

I'm sure this will be very useful for the community, since I'm pretty sure all of us share the same needs.\n\nWhen I started investing, I quickly faced a problem about how hard it is to track my portfolio.\n\n1. I had a few brokerage accounts so I had to manually go through reports for each account.\n2. Most data provided by brokers is very complex and a lot of it redundant if you're not a professional trader.\n3. Something that is very vital for a long term investor, such as \"yield on cost\" is unavailable etc.\n\nSo I started looking for a good tool to track it. I think I went though like 10 google pages and tried almost all of the existing trackers. Most of them are expensive and don't do the job too good.\n\nMost of them just show the data from the broker + aggregate some generic analytics, I'm not interested in.\n\nSo since I'm a software engineer I decided to build a simple tool for myself to simply track the aggregate of my portfolios performance (just the +-% graph). And it already felt more powerful than what I've used before!\n\nSo little, by little I started adding new things to it and now it does so many cool things, I haven't seen in any other tracker!\n\nMy friends and family love using it already and they gave me a lot of feedback. But I think that it's now the time to show it to a bigger audience to hear even more feedback and make this thing even better!\n\nI'm not good at describing so I'm just going to show you a few screenshots.\n\nIf you're interested, you can check it out on your portfolios: [https://bull-hold.com](https://bull-hold.com/)\n\nI don't collect any financial, brokerage data etc. All the website asks for is a CSV file with basic data like transaction date (approximate), number of shares, price, etc.\n\nIt's free and I don't have any ads on the website.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nz4u2sph21sa1.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ece255285a79308ffdb9588e95618be0e2620d50\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vao973fi21sa1.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6427e721cc44a313a2f87e5ecb1a7df86a2b8061\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xvh4sw4j21sa1.png?width=1335&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=36b4664c3e0da0f277b968eb292b331339294579\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u97ehyvj21sa1.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f55c3136b0fb4a5f99425fc17b8ebeea0e357859\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s6quwsgk21sa1.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cc0d4a2aa0dbb7c449a41c58c0021f574d621c71", "post URL info": ["https://bull-hold.com](https://bull-hold.com/)", "https://preview.redd.it/nz4u2sph21sa1.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ece255285a79308ffdb9588e95618be0e2620d50", "https://preview.redd.it/vao973fi21sa1.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6427e721cc44a313a2f87e5ecb1a7df86a2b8061", "https://preview.redd.it/xvh4sw4j21sa1.png?width=1335&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=36b4664c3e0da0f277b968eb292b331339294579", "https://preview.redd.it/u97ehyvj21sa1.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f55c3136b0fb4a5f99425fc17b8ebeea0e357859", "https://preview.redd.it/s6quwsgk21sa1.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cc0d4a2aa0dbb7c449a41c58c0021f574d621c71"], "author": "StoryTimeFromReddit", "ups": "16", "downs": "0", "number of comments": "14", "comments": ["Ok just don\u2019t go corporate America on us.", "Good work btw.", "[removed]", "It looks very nice.

That's easy to do in an active management portfolio because there isn't enough effort possible to deeply study too many equities.\n\nIt also means a small number of portfolios will occasionally have amazing returns if they did include the positive outliers.\n\nThis is consistent with the notion that post industrial revolution, economic gains are made by technological shifts whose benefits are often concentrated in a few companies.

The company was founded in 1849 and is headquartered in New York City.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qs3hrdv3k4sa1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ed21a3a760bc9017b97796ae8ecd3f11267fce61\n\nPFE's stock has been on a downward trend in recent months, down more than 18% since the beginning of the year. The company's stock is currently trading at around $42 per share, near its 52-week low.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c0mnyhzf64sa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=80ff3f34a4145608e90579451af3cb4aa4a5c384\n\nBears\n\n1. There are a few reasons for PFE's stock decline. First, the company is facing headwinds from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has led to a decline in demand for some of PFE's products, such as its antiviral drug Paxlovid.\n2. PFE is facing competition from generic drugs. Generic drugs are lower-cost alternatives to brand-name drugs, and they are becoming more widely available. This competition is eating into PFE's profits.\n\nBulls\n\n1. However, there are also some reasons to be optimistic about PFE. The company is a leader in the pharmaceutical industry, and it has a strong track record. Pfizer's pipeline productivity is improving with several successful recent drug launches. In particular, cardiovascular drug Vyndaqel is a potential game-changer in the rare-disease arena.\n2. Pfizer's strong success in developing a COVID-19 vaccine and treatment is yielding a massive cash windfall.\n3. Pfizer's decision to divest its off-patent division should result in a faster-growing, innovative company.\n\nHere are some additional details about PFE's financial performance:\n\n* PFE's revenue for the 2022 fiscal year was 100 billion, up 23% from the previous year. Net income for the 2022 fiscal year was $31.0 billion, up 42% from the previous year.\n* PFE's dividend yield is 3.9%.\n* PFE's P/E ratio is 7.5.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hlya9nqi64sa1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9a049eeab37c436b2f1d03f9fe3ac2f6cea52dac\n\nThe fair value estimate for Pfizer is $48 according to Morningstar analyst. Excluding COVID-19 product sales, the core business of Pfizer is expected to experience close to 6% annual sales growth between 2020 and 2025 as new drugs offset generic competition. Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine and treatment sales are expected to create very strong growth in 2021 and 2022 but likely weigh on growth by 2023 as demand for Pfizer's vaccine and treatment slows due to the likely fading of the pandemic. On the bottom line, a slightly healthier annual growth rate (excluding COVID-19 product sales) is projected during the next five years as cost-cutting plans and share buybacks take shape. Unannounced acquisitions are not modeled, but acquisitions hold the potential to accelerate the company's growth rate. Over the long term, the more diversified lineup of drugs should reduce the volatility of earnings. Restructuring efforts are anticipated to help alleviate some margin pressure, as some high-margin products lose exclusivity. The cost of equity for Pfizer is estimated at 7.5%, and the weighted average cost of capital is 7%, which is in line with the peer group.", "post URL info": ["https://preview.redd.it/afnr7ne764sa1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dc0dcb428366e168504e24badfdbf2c73688c665", "https://preview.redd.it/qs3hrdv3k4sa1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ed21a3a760bc9017b97796ae8ecd3f11267fce61", "https://preview.redd.it/c0mnyhzf64sa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=80ff3f34a4145608e90579451af3cb4aa4a5c384", "https://preview.redd.it/hlya9nqi64sa1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9a049eeab37c436b2f1d03f9fe3ac2f6cea52dac"], "author": "Gofighting777", "ups": "0", "downs": "0", "number of comments": "5", "comments": ["No, they are not undervalued. If you think with 1 hour of research you figured what the market is missing, then I have a flying bridge to sell you.\n\nCyclical pharmaceutical company with lots of uncertainties. Unless you understand their whole portfolio of drugs, your analysis is rubbish. Literally half to PFE revenue last year are COVID related.", "Projected revenue and earnings guidance for 2023 is 61-71 billion and 3.25-3.45 eps. That would give them a fwd P/e estimate of around 12 which is still incredibly low relative to the overall pharmaceutical industry. I\u2019m bullish heading into the next earnings report. Especially with the $ weakening overseas sales won\u2019t be as affected. They also have the Humira generic bio similar launching soon, which brings in billions of revenue for Abbvie. The RSV vaccine getting approval would be a cherry on top", "I just commented separately below, but if you look at their fwd estimates for 2023 their fwd P/E is around 12. Which is still relatively low compared to the large cap biotech sector. You\u2019re right, their earnings are getting decimated without covid related treatment demand. Last year revenue was 100 billion and for 2023 they predict 60-70 billion, and about a 50% reduction in eps from 6.58 last year to 3.25 this year. Covid was a major impact on their business, but the overall business aside from Covid treatments is still thriving. Now MRNA on the other hand\u2026", "Again, you are claiming you see a value in a company beyond what the market is seeing based on two points.\n\nIt is all about their drug portfolio, and patents. If you want to argue a multiple expansion, then sure its your analysis.\n\nYou are either look at a major catalyst, like COVID, or shear outrageous undervaluation by the market, and I don\u2019t see either case.  I don\u2019t see PFE 2-3x their revenue or FCF over the next 5 years, and now its a matter of should they trade at a higher multiple", "That is my thesis, I believe the stock has sold off below the average valuations for biotech stocks. The current average price to sales ratio of the seven major drug manufacturers is 5.3. So it actually isn\u2019t out of reach for Pfizer to be trading 3x revenue. Even if they only achieve 60 billion in revenue, which is the lower ends of estimates, at the current market cap that is only 3.8x revenue. Which is still below the average P/S ratio of the sector.\n\nAlso considering P/FCF, the average ratio for the seven major drug manufacturers is 62. Pfizer is at the bottom with a current P/FCF of 14 rounded up. Even if that ratio expands, which it will when their revenues decline, they will still be trading well below the sector average."]}

New Zealand\u2019s central bank overnight hiked rates by 50 basis points, noting that inflation was \u201ctoo high and persistent.\u201d\n*****\n> On Tuesday, the Dow shed nearly 200 points, snapping a four-day win streak as broader economic concerns weighed on equities. The S&P 500 fell by 0.58%, also snapping a string of four consecutive winning sessions. The Nasdaq Composite dropped by 0.52%.\n*****\n> Investors digested the latest job openings report that suggested the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to cool the labor market might finally be having an effect. In February, the number of available positions fell below 10 million for the first time in nearly two years.\n*****\n> Meanwhile, the energy market added to uncertainty this week after OPEC+ said it would cut output by 1.16 million barrels of oil per day.\n*****\n> \u201cI think it\u2019s some consolidation after a stellar rally that we had last week,\u201d Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital, said Tuesday on CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell.\u201d\n*****\n> \u201cBut that still doesn\u2019t deter me from saying that I think we can have a more positive tone to April because if you look at the broader picture, we sort of have the recipe for a soft landing, which is inflation expectations are coming down.

So that actually still supports a resilient stock market,\u201d Amoroso added.\n*****\n> On Wednesday, traders are expecting the latest ADP private payrolls report before the bell. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting a rise of 210,000 jobs in March, down from an increase of 242,000 in the previous month.\n*****\n> The latest reading of the ISM Services Index is also set to release.

Although market forces can push the price higher or lower, at the end of the day, the Fed has unlimited ability to buy Treasuries to push the price higher and thus yields lower, or if it wants interest rates to rise instead, it can pay interest directly on reserves. Under the current rules of the system, there is no limit to the Fed's ability to push interest rates at least down to zero. If it chooses to raise rates, which is certainly a possibility, especially when inflation is high, then that actually increases the attractiveness of the dollar. You always see people rush into the dollar when interest rates rise. And in any case, for those that hold US Treasuries, there is no demanding to be paid in other currencies; that's patently absurd. You get dollars from treasuries; you can't just demand that the US provide you with some other currency, lol.\n\n>end of the fantasy world where our government can borrow limitlessly\n\nJust like the FED with interest rates, there is no technical limit to the amount of spending that Congress can authorize. If they really explode the budget deficit, you can probably expect that to result in some inflation. But you should NOT expect a collapse of the dollar, or for people domestically to stop accepting it.\n\nThe USD is undoubtedly going to diminish in relative importance on the global stage. The original premise was that the USD is going to \"collapse\" in some way. I don't think that's reasonable. It will certainly continue to inflate, as it always has done, and the international market will probably slowly stop demanding dollars as assiduously as they historically have. One day the USD will \"fail\" in the sense that it will no longer circulate as money. That's true of every fiat, making it a tautology. That's all I was pointing out with my original comment.", "When people talk about the collapsing they mean specifically LA, and I am sure you are in LA or are from there.
